It does this by splitting at each space.  If there are multiple spaces between words, it will treat them as one space.  If you want to split at multiple characters, you can pass them to the split() function as a string.  For example, split(\",\") would split at commas.  If you want to split at any of multiple characters, you can pass them to the split() function as a string of characters.  For example, split(\",;\") would split at commas or semicolons.  If you want to split at any whitespace character, you can pass a string of whitespace characters to the split() function.  For example, split(\"\\s\") would split at any whitespace character.  If you want to split at any whitespace character and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, you can use the strip() function to remove the leading and trailing whitespace before splitting the string.  For example, strip().split() would split the string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.  If you want to split at any whitespace character and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each item in the list, you can use the strip() function to remove the leading and trailing whitespace from each item in the list after splitting the string.

If you want to split at any whitespace character and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each item in the list and also convert each item in the list to lowercase, you can use the strip() function to remove the leading and trailing whitespace from each item in the list and the lower() function to convert each item in the list to lowercase after splitting the string.  For example, strip().split().lower() would split the string, remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each item in the list, and convert each item in the list to lowercase.  If you want to split at any whitespace character and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each item in the list and also convert each item in the list to lowercase and also remove any duplicate items from the list, you can use the strip() function to remove the leading and trailing whitespace from each item in the list, the lower() function to convert each item in the list to lowercase, and the list comprehension to remove any duplicate items from the list after splitting the string.  For example, strip().split().lower() would split the string, remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each item in the list, convert each item in the list to lowercase, and remove any duplicate items from the list.  If you want to split at any whitespace character and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the string and also remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each item in the list and also convert each item in the list to lowercase and also remove any duplicate items from the list and also sort the list, you can use the strip() function to remove the leading and trailing whitespace from each item in the list, the lower() function to convert each item in the list to lowercase, the list comprehension to remove any duplicate items from the list, and the sort() function to sort the list after splitting the string.

If the input string can contain uppercase letters or other characters, the solution needs to be modified accordingly.  # This solution also assumes that the input string does not contain any duplicate characters. If the input string can contain duplicate characters, the solution needs to be modified accordingly.  # This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dp[i][j] variable is used to store the length of the longest repeating subsequence that ends at position i and j. The max_len variable is used to store the length of the longest repeating subsequence found so far.  # The solution first initializes the dp[i][j] variables to 0. Then it iterates over all possible lengths of the repeating subsequence, from 1 to n. For each length, it iterates over all possible starting positions of the repeating subsequence, from 0 to n - length. For each starting position, it checks if the character at the starting position is the same as the character at the ending position. If they are the same, it checks if the length of the repeating subsequence is greater than 1. If it is, it checks if the characters at the positions i + 1 and j - 1 are the same. If they are the same, it means that the repeating subsequence can be extended by one character, so it sets dp[i][j] to dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 1. If the characters at the positions i + 1 and j - 1 are not the same, it means that the repeating subsequence cannot be extended by one character, so it sets dp[i][j] to 1. If the characters at the starting and ending positions are not the same, it sets dp[i][j] to 1. Finally, it updates the max_len variable to be the maximum of the current max_len and dp[i][j].  # After iterating over all possible lengths and starting positions, the max_len variable stores the length of the longest repeating subsequence found. The function returns max_len * 2 if max_len > 0, otherwise it returns 0.  # The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the solution iterates over all possible lengths of the repeating subsequence, from 1 to n, and for each length, it iterates over all possible starting positions of the repeating subsequence, from 0 to n - length.  # The space complexity of this solution is also O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the solution uses a 2D array dp of size n x n to store the lengths of the longest repeating subsequences.  # In summary, this solution uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest repeating subsequence in a given string. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string.  # The solution assumes that the input string only contains lowercase letters and does not contain any duplicate characters. If the input string can contain uppercase letters or other characters, or if it can contain duplicate characters, the solution needs to be modified accordingly.  # The solution uses a 2D array dp to store the lengths of the longest repeating subsequences.

calculate the area of a pentagon with n sides. The formula is (n * (3 + sqrt(5))) / (4 * sqrt(5)) * (sqrt(5)) ** 2. This is a simplified version of the formula. The formula is derived from the formula for the area of a regular polygon: A = (n * s^2) / (4 * tan(\u03c0/n)), where s is the length of a side and n is the number of sides. For a pentagon, n = 5. The length of a side can be calculated using the formula s = 2 * sin(\u03c0/n). Substituting this into the formula for the area of a regular polygon gives the formula for the area of a pentagon.
