Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe have an array of numbers, and we need to check if any two numbers in this array are closer to each other than a given threshold. If such a pair exists, we return false (since the problem says \"are any two numbers closer than the threshold\", so if any pair is within the threshold, the function should return false; wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Check if in given array of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.\" So, if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, return false? Or return true?\n\nWait, the examples:\n\nFirst example: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], threshold 0.5. The function returns false. Because the closest pair is 1 and 2, which are 1 apart. So 1 is greater than 0.5, so no pair is closer than the threshold. So the function returns false.\n\nSecond example: [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], threshold 0.3. The function returns true. Because 2.8 and 2.0 are 0.8 apart, which is more than 0.3, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2.8 and 2.0 are 0.8 apart. So that's more than 0.3. But wait, perhaps 2.8 and 3.0 are 0.2 apart, which is less than 0.3. So that's a pair that is closer than the threshold. So the function returns true.\n\nWait, so the function returns true if any two numbers are closer than the threshold. So, the function should return true if there exists at least one pair of numbers in the array that are closer than the threshold. Otherwise, return false.\n\nSo, the function should return true if any two numbers are within the threshold distance, else false.\n\nSo, the problem is to find if there exists a pair of numbers in the array where the absolute difference is less than the threshold. If such a pair exists, return false; else, return true.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the function is called has_close_elements. So, the function returns true if any two numbers are closer than the threshold. So, if any pair is within the threshold, return true. Otherwise, return false.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-examine the examples.\n\nFirst example: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], threshold 0.5. The function returns false. Because the closest pair is 1 and 2, which are 1 apart. So, 1 is greater than 0.5, so no pair is within the threshold. So function returns false.\n\nSecond example: [1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], threshold 0.3. The function returns true. Because 2.8 and 2.0 are 0.8 apart, which is more than 0.3. But wait, 2.8 and 3.0 are 0.2 apart, which is less than 0.3. So, that's a pair that is within the threshold. So function returns true.\n\nSo, the function should return true if any two numbers are within the threshold distance. So, the function should return true if the minimal distance between any two numbers is less than the threshold. Otherwise, return false.\n\nSo, the approach is to compute all possible pairs of numbers in the array, compute their absolute differences, find the minimal difference, and check if that minimal difference is less than the threshold. If yes, return true; else, return false.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible pairs of numbers in the array.\n\n2. For each pair, compute the absolute difference.\n\n3. Keep track of the minimal difference found.\n\n4. After checking all pairs, compare the minimal difference with the threshold.\n\n5. If the minimal difference is less than the threshold, return true. Else, return false.\n\nSo, the function can be implemented as follows.\n\nNow,"], ["//Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to\n// separate those group into separate strings and return the array of those.\n// Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other\n// Ignore any spaces in the input string.\n// >>> separate_paren_groups(\"( ) (( )) (( )( ))\")\n// [\"()\", \"(())\", \"(()())\"]\nfunction separate_paren_groups(paren_string){ ...}\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to separate groups of nested parentheses into separate strings. The input is a string with multiple groups of nested parentheses, and I need to return an array of those groups, each balanced.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The example given is \"( ) (( )) (( )( ))\" which should return [\"()\", \"(())\", \"(()())\"]. So, the first group is just \"()\", the second is \"(())\", and the third is \"(()())\".\n\nSo, the task is to parse the input string, identify each group of nested parentheses, and then collect those groups into separate strings.\n\nHow can I approach this? Well, I think I can use a stack-based approach. The idea is to keep track of the current level of parentheses. When I encounter an opening parenthesis, I push the current level onto the stack and start a new level. When I encounter a closing parenthesis, I pop the current level from the stack. Each time I pop, I know that I've found a complete group of parentheses, and I can add it to the result array.\n\nBut wait, the input string can have spaces, so I need to first remove all the spaces. That's an important step. So, the first step is to process the input string by removing all spaces.\n\nOnce I have the string without spaces, I can iterate through each character. I'll need to keep track of the current depth of the parentheses. Each time I encounter an opening parenthesis '(', I increase the depth. Each time I encounter a closing parenthesis ')', I decrease the depth. When the depth becomes zero, it means that I've found a complete group of parentheses, and I can add this group to the result array.\n\nWait, but how do I know when the depth becomes zero? Because each complete group of parentheses starts with an opening and ends with a closing, so the depth should go from zero to one, then back to zero. So, when the depth is zero, that's the end of a group.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Remove all spaces from the input string.\n2. Initialize a stack to keep track of the current depth of parentheses.\n3. Initialize a result array to collect the groups.\n4. Initialize a current depth variable, starting at zero.\n5. Iterate through each character in the processed string:\n   a. If the character is '(', increment the current depth.\n   b. If the character is ')', decrement the current depth.\n   c. If the current depth becomes zero, it means we've found a complete group. So, we push the current depth (which is zero) onto the stack, and then push the current string (the substring from the previous end to the current position) onto the stack. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the current string is the substring that was just closed, so when we find the closing parenthesis, the current string is the group. So, when the depth becomes zero, we can take the current string as the group and add it to the result array. Then, we need to reset the current string to empty, and reset the current depth to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to track the start and end indices of each group. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, when the depth becomes zero, we can take the substring from the previous end to the current position as the group, add it to the result, and then reset the current string and current depth.\n\nWait, perhaps the stack can hold the current string when the depth is zero. So, when the depth is zero, we push the current string onto the stack, and then push the current string again? No, that's not correct. Because each time we find a group, we should add it to the result array, and then reset the current string and current depth.\n\nWait, perhaps the stack can hold the current string when the depth is zero. So, when we encounter a closing parenthesis, we decrement the depth. If the depth becomes zero, we push the current string onto the stack, and then reset the current string to empty, and current depth to zero.\n\nWait, no. Because the current string is the substring that was just closed. So, when we find a closing parenthesis, we can take the current string, add it to the result array, and then reset the current string to empty, and current depth to zero.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Initialize stack as empty.\n- Initialize current_string as empty.\n- Initialize current_depth as 0"], ["//Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n// and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n// (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n// Return the decimal part of the number.\n// >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n// 0.5\nfunction truncate_number(number){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, so I need to write a JavaScript function called truncate_number that takes a positive floating point number and returns its decimal part after truncating the integer part. The decimal part should be returned as a string with a leading zero if necessary. For example, if the input is 3.5, the output should be \"0.5\".\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let's think about the steps involved.\n\nFirst, I need to separate the integer part from the decimal part. The integer part is the largest integer smaller than the given number. The decimal part is the remainder after subtracting the integer part from the original number.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is 3.5, the integer part is 3, and the decimal part is 0.5.\n\nHow can I get the integer part? Well, in JavaScript, I can use the Math.floor function. Math.floor(3.5) gives 3, which is the integer part. Then, subtracting this from the original number gives me the decimal part.\n\nWait, but what about numbers like 4.999999999? Math.floor would give 4, and subtracting that from 4.999999999 would give 0.999999999, which is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Get the integer part using Math.floor(number).\n2. Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.\n3. Convert the decimal part to a string, ensuring that it has a leading zero if necessary.\n\nWait, but how do I convert the decimal part to a string with a leading zero? Because if the decimal part is less than 1, it should be represented as a single digit after the decimal point, like \"0.5\".\n\nSo, perhaps I can format the decimal part as a string with one decimal place. But wait, what if the decimal part is something like 0.9999999999999999? Should I round it to 1.0? No, because the problem says to truncate, not round. So, for example, 3.999999999 should become 0.999999999, not 1.0.\n\nSo, the decimal part is the original number minus the integer part, and we need to represent it as a string with as many decimal digits as needed, but without any rounding.\n\nSo, how can I get the decimal part as a string with leading zeros if necessary? Because if the decimal part is, say, 0.5, we need to show it as \"0.5\", but if it's 0.9999999999999999, we need to show it as \"0.9999999999999999\".\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, when you convert a number to a string, it might not show all the decimal digits. For example, 0.5 is 0.5, but 0.9999999999999999 is 1.0, but in reality, it's 0.9999999999999999, which is less than 1. So, how can I represent it correctly?\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the function is supposed to return the decimal part as a string. So, perhaps the correct approach is to take the decimal part, and if it's less than 1, represent it as a string with one decimal digit, but if it's more than 1, perhaps we need to represent it as a string with as many digits as needed. But wait, no, because the decimal part is always less than 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the decimal part is the remainder after subtracting the integer part. So, the decimal part is always less than 1. So, for example, 3.5 becomes 0.5, 3.999999999999999 becomes 0.9999999999999999, which is less than 1.\n\nSo, the decimal part is always less than 1, so when we represent it as a string, it will have at least one digit after the decimal point.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the function is called"], ["//You're given an array of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n// zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and\n// at that point function should return true. Otherwise it should return false.\n// >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])\n// false\n// >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])\n// true\nfunction below_zero(operations){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe are given an array of operations, each being either a deposit (positive number) or a withdrawal (negative number). The account starts with a zero balance. We need to check if at any point the balance falls below zero. If it does, return true; otherwise, return false.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input [1, 2, 3], the balance never goes below zero, so the function returns false. In the second sample [1, 2, -4, 5], after the third operation, the balance is 1+2-4 = -1, which is below zero, so the function returns true.\n\nSo, the approach is to simulate the balance as we process each operation. We'll start with a balance of 0. For each operation in the array, we'll add the value to the balance. After each addition, we'll check if the balance is negative. If it is, we return true immediately. If we process all operations without the balance ever being negative, we return false.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nThe function is called below_zero and takes operations as a parameter. So, inside the function, I'll initialize a balance variable to 0. Then, loop through each operation in the operations array. For each operation, add the value to balance. Then, check if balance is less than zero. If yes, return true. If after all operations, balance is still >=0, return false.\n\nWait, but what about the order of operations? Each element in the operations array is a single deposit or withdrawal. So, for example, if the operations are [3, -5, 2], the balance after each step is 3, -2, 0. So, the balance is -2 at the second step, which is below zero, so function returns true.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize balance = 0.\n\n2. For each op in operations:\n\n   a. balance += op.\n\n   b. if balance < 0, return true.\n\n3. After all ops, return false.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: [1, 2, 3]\n\nbalance starts at 0.\n\nAfter 1: 1 >=0, no return.\n\nAfter 2: 3 >=0, no return.\n\nAfter 3: 6 >=0, no return.\n\nAfter all, return false. Correct.\n\nSample 2: [1, 2, -4, 5]\n\nAfter 1: 1 >=0.\n\nAfter 2: 3 >=0.\n\nAfter -4: 3-4 = -1 <0. So return true.\n\nAnother test case: [5, -6, 3]\n\nAfter 5: 5 >=0.\n\nAfter -6: 5-6 = -1 <0. Return true.\n\nAnother test case: [3, -3, 2]\n\nAfter 3: 3 >=0.\n\nAfter -3: 0 >=0.\n\nAfter 2: 2 >=0.\n\nNo returns, so return false.\n\nAnother test case: [ -1, 2, 3 ]\n\nAfter -1: -1 <0. Return true.\n\nAnother test case: [2, -3, 1]\n\nAfter 2: 2 >=0.\n\nAfter -3: -1 <0. Return true.\n\nAnother test case: [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]\n\nEach step, balance goes back to 0, then 1, 0, 1, 0, 1. So, no negative balance. So function returns false.\n\nSo, the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, let's implement this in JavaScript.\n\nThe function will be:\n"], ["//For a given array of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n// around the mean of this dataset.\n// Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n// element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n// MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n// >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n// 1.0\nfunction mean_absolute_deviation(numbers){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called mean_absolute_deviation that takes an array of numbers and returns the mean absolute deviation around the mean of this dataset. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the mean of the dataset. The mean is the average of all the numbers. So, I can sum all the numbers and then divide by the count of numbers. That's straightforward.\n\nOnce I have the mean, I need to calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean. Then, I sum all these absolute differences and divide by the count of numbers to get the mean absolute deviation.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, I have to make sure that I handle the array correctly. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.\n2. Divide the sum by the length of the array to get the mean.\n3. For each number in the array, subtract the mean and take the absolute value.\n4. Sum all these absolute differences.\n5. Divide the sum by the length of the array to get the mean absolute deviation.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is empty? Oh, the problem says it's given an array of input numbers, so I don't have to handle that case. So I can assume the array is non-empty.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFunction mean_absolute_deviation(numbers) {\n\nFirst, calculate the mean:\n\nlet mean = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0) / numbers.length;\n\nThen, calculate the sum of absolute differences:\n\nlet sum = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => Math.abs(num - mean), 0);\n\nThen, the mean absolute deviation is sum divided by the length:\n\nreturn sum / numbers.length;\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me test it with the sample input.\n\nSample input: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\n\nSum is 1+2+3+4=10. Mean is 10/4=2.5.\n\nAbsolute differences: |1-2.5|=1.5, |2-2.5|=0.5, |3-2.5|=0.5, |4-2.5|=1.5. Sum is 1.5+0.5+0.5+1.5=4. So mean absolute deviation is 4/4=1.0, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5]. Mean is 5. Differences are 0,0,0. Mean absolute deviation is 0.\n\nAnother test case: [10, 20, 30]. Mean is 20. Differences are 10,0,10. Sum is 20. Mean absolute deviation is 20/3 \u22486.6667.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nWait, but what about data types? The function is written to take numbers, but in JavaScript, if the array contains non-numeric values, it will throw an error. But the problem says it's given an array of input numbers, so we can assume that all elements are numbers.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n"], ["//Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input array `numbers'\n// >>> intersperse([], 4)\n// []\n// >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n// [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\nfunction intersperse(numbers, delimeter){}\n\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's see. The task is to write a function called intersperse that takes two arguments: numbers and delimeter. The function should insert the delimeter between every two consecutive elements of the input array numbers. \n\nWait, let me read the example again. The first example is intersperse([], 4), which returns an empty array. That makes sense because there are no elements to insert between. \n\nThe second example is intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4), which returns [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]. So, between each pair of consecutive numbers, we insert 4. So, 1 and 2 become 1,4,2; 2 and 3 become 2,4,3. \n\nSo, the function needs to take each element in the numbers array and insert the delimeter between them. \n\nHmm, how can I approach this? Well, one way is to loop through each element of the numbers array and for each element except the last one, add the element followed by the delimeter. Then, add the last element without the delimeter. \n\nAlternatively, I can create a new array by interleaving the elements. So, for each index i in numbers, I can add numbers[i] and then delimeter, except when i is the last index. \n\nWait, but in the example, the last element is 3, and the output is [1,4,2,4,3]. So, the last element is added without the delimeter. \n\nSo, the plan is: create a new array. For each element in numbers, add it to the new array, then add the delimeter, except for the last element. \n\nBut wait, how do I handle the last element? Maybe I can loop through each element, and for each element except the last, add it and the delimeter. Then, add the last element without the delimeter. \n\nAlternatively, I can use a loop that goes from 0 to the length of numbers, and for each i, add numbers[i] and then delimeter, except when i is the last index. \n\nWait, but in the second example, the numbers are [1,2,3], and the output is [1,4,2,4,3]. So, the delimeter is inserted between 1 and 2, and between 2 and 3. So, the output is [1,4,2,4,3]. \n\nSo, the approach is to create a new array, and for each element except the last, add the element and the delimeter. Then, add the last element. \n\nWait, no. Because in the second example, the output is [1,4,2,4,3], which is the original elements with 4 inserted between each. So, the new array is [1,4,2,4,3]. \n\nSo, the way to do this is to create a new array, and for each element in numbers except the last, add the element and then the delimeter. Then, add the last element. \n\nWait, no. Because in the second example, the numbers are [1,2,3], and the output is [1,4,2,4,3]. So, the new array is [1,4,2,4,3]. So, the elements are 1, then 4, then 2, then 4, then 3. \n\nSo, the way to do this is to loop through each element in numbers, and for each element except the last, add it and the delimeter. Then, add the last element. \n\nWait, but in the first example, numbers is empty, so the output is empty. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if numbers is empty. If yes, return empty array.\n\n2. Otherwise, create a new array.\n\n3. Loop through each element in numbers:\n\n   a. For each element except the last, add the element and the delimeter.\n\n   b. For the last element, add it without the delimeter.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the last element is 3, and it's added as is. So, the new array is [1,4,2,4,3].\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n"], ["//Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.\n// For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.\n// E.g.

For example, \"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())\" is given, and the output is [2, 3, 1, 3].\n\nSo, I need to parse this string, identify each group of parentheses, and for each group, determine the maximum level of nesting.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the first step is to split the input string into individual groups of parentheses. Each group is separated by a space, and each group is a substring that starts with '(' and ends with ')'. So, for example, in the input string, the first group is \"(()())\", the second is \"((()))\", and so on.\n\nOnce I have each group, I need to determine the maximum depth of nesting for that group. The depth is the number of open parentheses at the deepest point in the group.\n\nSo, for each group, I can process it character by character, keeping track of the current depth. Each time I encounter a '(', I increase the depth, and each time I encounter a ')', I decrease the depth. The maximum depth encountered during this process is the depth of that group.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the input string into individual groups. Each group is a substring that starts with '(' and ends with ')'. So, for example, the input string is split into [\"(()())\", \"((()))\", \"()\", \"((())()())\"].\n\n2. For each group, compute the maximum depth of nesting.\n\n3. Collect these maximum depths into a list and return it.\n\nSo, the first step is to split the input string into groups. How can I do that in Python?\n\nWell, the input string is a sequence of groups separated by spaces. Each group is a substring starting with '(' and ending with ')'. So, I can split the string into parts using the split() method, but that would split on any whitespace, including spaces between groups. Wait, no. Wait, the input is a string where each group is separated by a space. So, for example, \"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())\" is split into [\"(()())\", \"((()))\", \"()\", \"((())()())\"].\n\nSo, the split() method with default arguments will split on any whitespace, including spaces, tabs, etc. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code can be:\n\ngroups = paren_string.split()\n\nThen, for each group in groups, we can process it.\n\nNow, for each group, how do we compute the maximum depth?\n\nWe can process each character in the group, keeping track of the current depth. Initialize depth to 0, max_depth to 0.\n\nFor each char in group:\n\n- if char is '(', increment depth by 1.\n\n- if char is ')', decrement depth by 1.\n\n- after each step, update max_depth if current depth is greater than max_depth.\n\nSo, for example, for the group \"(()())\":\n\n- '(', depth becomes 1, max_depth is 1.\n\n- '(', depth becomes 2, max_depth is 2.\n\n- ')', depth becomes 1.\n\n- '(', depth becomes 2.\n\n- ')', depth becomes 1.\n\n- ')', depth becomes 0.\n\nSo, the max_depth is 2.\n\nSimilarly, for the group \"((()))\":\n\n- '(', depth 1.\n\n- '(', depth 2.\n\n- '(', depth 3.\n\n- ')', depth 2.\n\n- ')', depth 1.\n\n- ')', depth 0.\n\nSo, max_depth is 3.\n\nSo, the code for processing a group is:\n\ndef max_depth(group):\n    max_d = 0\n    current_d = 0\n    for c in group:\n        if c == '(':\n            current_d += 1\n            if current_d > max_d:\n                max_d = current_d\n        elif c == ')':\n            current_d -= 1\n    return max_d\n\nWait, but in the case of a group that starts with '(', which is the case for all groups, since each group is a substring starting with '(', so the initial current_d is at least 1.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef max_depth(group):\n    current_depth = 0\n"], ["//Filter an input array of strings only for ones that contain given substring\n// >>> filter_by_substring([], \"a\")\n// []\n// >>> filter_by_substring([\"abc\", \"bacd\", \"cde\", \"array\"], \"a\")\n// [\"abc\", \"bacd\", \"array\"]\nfunction filter_by_substring(strings, substring){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called filter_by_substring that takes two arguments: an array of strings and a substring. The function should return a new array containing only the strings from the input array that contain the given substring. \n\nWait, but in the sample code, the function is called with an empty array and \"a\", and it returns an empty array. So, the function should filter out any string that does not contain the substring. \n\nSo, the function needs to loop through each string in the input array and check if the substring is present in the string. If it is, include it in the resulting array. \n\nHow can I do this in Python? Well, I can use a list comprehension for this. The list comprehension will iterate over each string in the input array, and for each string, it will include it in the new list only if the substring is in the string. \n\nSo, the code would look something like this:\n\nreturn [s for s in strings if substring in s]\n\nWait, but in the sample code, the function is called with an empty array, and it returns an empty array. So, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, what if the substring is an empty string? Well, in that case, every string would contain the empty string, so the function would return all the strings. But that's probably beyond the scope of this problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the function can be written as:\n\ndef filter_by_substring(strings, substring):\n    return [s for s in strings if substring in s]\n\nWait, but in the sample code, the function is called with an empty array, and it returns an empty array.

Oh, and if the array is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1. Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to handle the case where the input array is empty. So, if numbers.length is 0, then the sum is 0 and the product is 1. That's straightforward.\n\nBut what if the array isn't empty? Then I need to calculate the sum and the product of all the numbers in the array. So, for the sum, I can just loop through each number and add them up. For the product, I can loop through each number and multiply them together.\n\nWait, but what if the array contains zeros? Well, that's okay because zero multiplied by anything is zero, so it won't affect the product. But if all the numbers are zero, the product will still be zero. So, no problem there.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Check if the input array is empty. If yes, return [0, 1].\n2. If not, calculate the sum of all elements.\n3. Calculate the product of all elements.\n4.

Let's see. The task is to generate an array of rolling maximum elements from a given array of integers. The rolling maximum is the maximum element found up to each point in the sequence. So, for each element in the input array, we need to find the maximum value from the start up to that element, and then build an array where each element is this maximum value.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the example given is [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], and the output is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]. Let's see:\n\n- The first element is 1, so the max is 1.\n- The second element is 2, so the max is 2.\n- The third is 3, so max is 3.\n- The fourth is 2, so the max remains 3.\n- The fifth is 3, so max is still 3.\n- The sixth is 4, so max becomes 4.\n- The seventh is 2, so max remains 4.\n\nSo the output is [1,2,3,3,3,4,4]. So the rolling maximum is the maximum up to and including the current element.\n\nSo the problem is to compute for each index i, the maximum of numbers[0..i]. So the output array is the array of these maximums.\n\nSo how can I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe naive approach is to, for each element, keep track of the maximum so far. But that would be O(n^2) time, which is acceptable for small n, but for larger n, it's not efficient.\n\nBut in this problem, perhaps the constraints are small, so the naive approach is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a deque data structure to keep track of potential maximums, similar to the approach used in the maximum sliding window problem.\n\nWait, but in this problem, we don't need a window; we need the maximum up to each index. So the deque approach might not be directly applicable.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can use a deque to keep track of the indices of the elements in the current window, but in this case, the window is the entire array up to each index. So the deque would help us find the maximum in O(1) time per element, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the naive approach is acceptable.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nInitialize a result array.\n\nInitialize a variable current_max to the first element.\n\nAdd current_max to the result array.\n\nThen, for each subsequent element in the array:\n\n- If the current element is greater than current_max, update current_max to this element.\n- Add current_max to the result array.\n\nWait, but that would not capture the maximum correctly. Because for each element, the maximum is the maximum of all elements up to that point, not just the current element.\n\nWait, no. Because for each element, the maximum is the maximum of all elements from the start up to that element. So for the first element, it's itself. For the second, it's the maximum of the first two. For the third, it's the maximum of the first three, and so on.\n\nSo the naive approach is to, for each element, keep track of the maximum so far, and add it to the result array.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for the third element, the maximum is the maximum of the first three elements, which could be the third element itself, or the second element, or the first.\n\nSo the naive approach is to, for each element, compute the maximum up to that point, and add it to the result array.\n\nSo for the array [1,2,3,2,3,4,2], the result array would be [1,2,3,3,3,4,4], which is correct.\n\nSo the naive approach is to:\n\n- Initialize result as an empty array.\n- Initialize current_max as the first element.\n- Add current_max to result.\n- For each element from index 1 to end:\n   - If element > current_max, set current_max to element.\n   - Add current_max to result.\n\nWait, but that's not correct.

The output should also be a string. \n\nHmm, I remember that binary XOR is a bitwise operation where each bit of the result is 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different, and 0 if they are the same. So, for each position in the two strings, I need to compare the bits and compute the XOR.\n\nWait, but the strings are of the same length, right? Because otherwise, how would the XOR be computed? Oh, the problem says that a and b are two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s. So I think they are of the same length. So I can process each corresponding pair of bits.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, \"010\" and \"110\" are given. Let's break them down:\n\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\n\nXOR each position:\n\n0 XOR 1 = 1\n1 XOR 1 = 0\n0 XOR 0 = 0\n\nSo the result is \"100\", which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the plan is to iterate through each character in the two strings, perform the XOR operation, and build the result string.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the case where the strings are of different lengths? The problem statement doesn't mention that, so perhaps we can assume that a and b are of the same length. Or maybe the function should handle cases where they are not, but the problem says that a and b are two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s. So perhaps the function can assume that a and b are of the same length.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate over each pair of characters from a and b.\n2. For each pair, compute the XOR.\n3. Append the result to the result string.\n4. Return the result string.\n\nSo, in code, how can I do this?\n\nIn Python, I can loop through each index, get the corresponding characters from a and b, convert them to integers, perform the XOR, then convert back to a character.\n\nWait, but in Python, the strings are immutable, so I can't modify them in place. So I need to create a new string.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\ndef string_xor(a, b):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        # get the ith character from a and b\n        a_char = a[i]\n        b_char = b[i]\n        # convert to integers\n        a_int = int(a_char)\n        b_int = int(b_char)\n        # compute XOR\n        xor = a_int ^ b_int\n        # append the result to the result list\n        result.append(str(xor))\n    # join the list into a string\n    return ''.join(result)\n\nWait, but what if the strings are of different lengths? For example, a is \"01\" and b is \"1\". Then, the loop will run for i in 0 and 1. For i=1, b[i] will cause an index error. So, perhaps the function should handle that, but the problem statement doesn't specify. So perhaps the function can assume that a and b are of the same length.\n\nSo, the code should work as is.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\na = \"010\", b = \"110\"\n\nLoop for i=0: a[0] is '0' (0), b[0] is '1' (1). 0 ^ 1 is 1. So append '1'.\n\ni=1: a[1] is '1' (1), b[1] is '1' (1). 1 ^ 1 is 0. Append '0'.\n\ni=2: a[2] is '0' (0), b[2] is '0' (0). 0 ^ 0 is 0.

If there are multiple strings of the same maximum length, I should return the first one in the array.

In that case, the function should return undefined.\n\nIf the array is not empty, I need to find the string with the maximum length. If there are multiple strings with the same maximum length, I need to return the first one in the array.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the input array is empty. If yes, return undefined.\n2. Initialize variables to keep track of the longest string found so far and its length.\n3. Iterate through each string in the array.\n4. For each string, compare its length with the current longest string's length.\n5. If the current string is longer, update the longest string and its length.\n6. If the current string is the same length as the longest, but comes after the current longest in the array, do not update because we need the first occurrence.\n7. After processing all strings, return the longest string.\n\nWait, but in step 6, if the current string is the same length as the longest, but comes after, we should not update because we need the first occurrence. So, we only update when a longer string is found, or when a string of the same length comes after the current longest.\n\nWait, no. Because if a string of the same length comes after, it's not the first occurrence. So, we should only update when a longer string is found, or when a string of the same length comes after the current longest.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about it. For example, in the sample input [\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\"], the longest is \"ccc\" because it's the last one. So, when processing \"a\", it's shorter, so no change. Then \"bb\" is shorter than \"ccc\", so no change. Then \"ccc\" is the same length as the current longest, but it's the last one. So, we don't update the longest string because we need the first occurrence of the maximum length.\n\nSo, the logic is: for each string, if it's longer than the current longest, update. If it's the same length but comes after the current longest, do not update. So, the first occurrence of the maximum length is the one we need.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize max_length to 0 and longest_str to undefined.\n\nFor each string in the array:\n\n   if the string's length is greater than max_length:\n\n       update max_length to the string's length\n\n       update longest_str to this string\n\n   else if the string's length is equal to max_length:\n\n       do nothing, because we need the first occurrence.\n\nSo, in the sample [\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\"], the first string is \"a\", which is length 1. Since 1 > 0, we update max_length to 1 and longest_str to \"a\".\n\nNext string is \"bb\", length 2. 2 > 1, so update max_length to 2 and longest_str to \"bb\".\n\nNext string is \"ccc\", length 3. 3 > 2, so update max_length to 3 and longest_str to \"ccc\".\n\nSo, the function returns \"ccc\".\n\nAnother example: [\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\", \"ddd\"]. The longest is \"ddd\" because it's the last one.\n\nAnother example: [\"ccc\", \"a\", \"bb\"]. The longest is \"ccc\" because it's the first one.\n\nAnother example: [\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\", \"d\", \"e\"]. The longest is \"ccc\".\n\nAnother example: [\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\"]. The longest is \"ccc\".\n\nAnother example: [\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"]. The longest is \"ccc\".\n\nAnother example: [\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\"]. The longest is \"h\".\n\nAnother example: [\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\"]. The longest is \"i\".\n\nAnother example: [\"a\", \"bb\", \""], ["//Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b\n// >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n// 1\n// >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n// 5\nfunction greatest_common_divisor(a, b){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a function called greatest_common_divisor that returns the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. Hmm, I remember that the greatest common divisor is the largest number that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. So, how do I compute that?\n\nI think the Euclidean algorithm is the way to go here. Let me recall how that works. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers by repeatedly applying division. The basic idea is that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. So, for example, GCD(a, b) is the same as GCD(b, a mod b), and this process continues until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo, applying this to the function, I can write a loop that continues to compute the remainder of a divided by b, and then sets a to b and b to the remainder, until b is zero. Then, a is the GCD.\n\nWait, but what if one of the numbers is zero? Because if b is zero, then the GCD is a, right? Because any number divides zero, so the GCD of a and 0 is a. Similarly, if a is zero, the GCD is b.\n\nSo, I need to handle the case where either a or b is zero. Let me think about the steps:\n\n1. If b is zero, return a.\n2. Else, compute the remainder of a divided by b.\n3. Set a to b and b to the remainder.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until b is zero.\n5. The current value of a is the GCD.\n\nWait, but in the Euclidean algorithm, the order matters. So, in the function, I should make sure that I handle the case where b is zero first, otherwise, I might end up with an infinite loop or incorrect results.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n"], ["//Return array of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string\n// >>> all_prefixes(\"abc\")\n// [\"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\"]\nfunction all_prefixes(string){ ...}\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to return an array of all prefixes from the shortest to the longest of the input string.

For example, the prefixes of the string \"abc\" are \"a\", \"ab\", and \"abc\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to generate all possible prefixes of a given string, starting from the shortest (1 character) up to the full length of the string.\n2. **Generate Prefixes**: For each position in the string, starting from 0, we take the substring from the beginning up to that position.

The notes can be whole, half, or quarter notes, and each note can be followed by another note. The function should parse the string correctly and return the beats array.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The input is a string where each note is represented by a combination of characters. The notes can be 'o', 'o|', or '.|'. Each of these represents a different type of note, and each has a specific duration in terms of beats. The task is to parse the string and convert each note into the number of beats it contributes.\n\nThe example given is:\n\nparse_music(\"o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o\") returns [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]\n\nLet me break down the example:\n\nThe input string is \"o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o\"\n\nLet's parse this step by step.\n\nThe string is split into individual notes separated by spaces. So, the first note is \"o\", then \"o|\", then \".|\", then \"o|\", then \"o|\", then \".|\", then \".|\", then \".|\", then \".|\", then \"o\", then \"o\".\n\nWait, but the initial string is \"o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o\". So, the first part is \"o\", then \"o|\", then \".|\", then \"o|\", then \"o|\", then \".|\", then \".|\", then \".|\", then \".|\", then \"o\", then \"o\".\n\nSo, the notes are:\n\n1. \"o\" \u2192 whole note \u2192 4 beats\n2. \"o|\" \u2192 half note \u2192 2 beats\n3. \".|\" \u2192 quarter note \u2192 1 beat\n4. \"o|\" \u2192 2 beats\n5. \"o|\" \u2192 2 beats\n6. \".|\" \u2192 1 beat\n7. \".|\" \u2192 1 beat\n8. \".|\" \u2192 1 beat\n9. \".|\" \u2192 1 beat\n10. \"o\" \u2192 4 beats\n11. \"o\" \u2192 4 beats\n\nSo, the output is [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4], which matches the example.\n\nSo, the function needs to process each note in the string, determine its type, and accumulate the beats accordingly.\n\nThe challenge is to correctly parse the string into individual notes, considering that each note is either a single character (like 'o') or two characters (like 'o|' or '.|').\n\nWait, no. Wait, the notes are either 'o', 'o|', or '.|'. So, each note is either a single character or two characters. So, the string is a sequence of these notes separated by spaces.\n\nSo, the first step is to split the input string into individual notes, considering that each note is either a single character or two characters. So, the string is split into tokens where each token is either a single character or two characters.\n\nWait, but the input string is a sequence of these notes separated by spaces. So, for example, \"o o|\" is split into \"o\", \"o|\".\n\nSo, the first step is to split the input string into a list of notes, where each note is either a single character or two characters, and then process each note to determine the number of beats.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the input string into individual notes, considering that each note is either a single character or two characters.

The function should return the number of times the substring can be found in the original string, including overlapping cases. For example, how_many_times(\"\", \"a\") should return 0 because there are no characters in the original string to match the substring. How_many_times(\"aaa\", \"a\") should return 3 because each 'a' in the original string matches the substring, and they can overlap. Similarly, how_many_times(\"aaaa\", \"aa\") should return 3 because the substring \"aa\" can be found starting at positions 0, 2, and 3 in the original string.\n\nSo, the function needs to count all possible starting positions in the original string where the substring can be found, including overlapping occurrences. The substring can be of any length, but it's important to note that the substring can be longer than the original string, in which case the function should return 0.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this problem. One way is to iterate through each possible starting index in the original string and check if the substring starting at that index matches the substring of the original string. If it does, increment the count and move to the next starting index. However, this approach can be inefficient for very long strings because it would require checking each possible starting position, which could take O(n*m) time, where n is the length of the original string and m is the length of the substring.\n\nBut given that the problem is for a coding challenge, perhaps the constraints are manageable, and a straightforward approach would suffice. So, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if the substring is longer than the original string. If so, return 0.\n2. Initialize a counter to 0.\n3. Iterate through each possible starting index in the original string. For each index, check if the substring starting at that index matches the substring of the original string.\n4. If it matches, increment the counter.\n5. Return the counter.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, the function is given as:\n\ndef how_many_times(string, substring):\n\nSo, the function takes two strings: the original and the substring.\n\nFirst, we need to handle the case where the substring is longer than the original string. So, if len(substring) > len(string), return 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNext, we need to iterate through each possible starting index. The starting index can be from 0 to len(string) - len(substring), inclusive. Because if the starting index is beyond that, the substring would go beyond the end of the original string.\n\nFor each starting index, we can extract a substring of the original string starting at that index and of length equal to the substring. Then, we compare this extracted substring with the given substring. If they are equal, we increment the counter.\n\nBut wait, in Python, strings are zero-indexed, so the starting index can be from 0 to len(string) - len(substring). So, for example, if the original string is length 5 and the substring is length 3, the starting index can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nSo, the loop would run for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1). Wait, no: len(string) - len(substring) + 1 is the number of possible starting indices. For example, if len(string) is 5 and len(substring) is 3, 5-3+1=3, which is correct.\n\nSo, the loop would be:\n\nfor i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):\n\nThen, for each i, check if string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring.\n\nIf yes, increment the counter.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndef how_many_times(string, substring):\n    if len(substring) > len(string):\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):\n        if string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nWait, but let's test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example: how_many_times(\"\", \"a\") should return 0. The code correctly returns 0 because len(substring) is 1, which is greater than 0.\n\nSecond example: how_many_times(\"aaa\", \"a\") should return 3. Let's see:\n\nThe loop runs for i in "], ["//Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.\n// Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.\n// Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest\n// >>> sort_numbers(\"three one five\")\n// \"one three five\"\nfunction sort_numbers(numbers){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called sort_numbers that takes a string of numbers and returns them sorted from smallest to largest. The input is a space-delimited string of digits from zero to nine. The output should be a string with the numbers sorted in ascending order.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to split the input string into individual number strings. That's easy with the split method. For example, if the input is \"three one five\", split by spaces gives [\"three\", \"one\", \"five\"].\n\nThen, I need to convert each of these strings into numbers so I can sort them. I can use the Number() function for that. So, numbersArray = numbers.split(' ').map(Number).\n\nOnce I have an array of numbers, I can sort them. The sort function should compare two numbers and return whether the first is less than the second. So, numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b).\n\nWait, but the output needs to be a string with the numbers in order. So after sorting, I need to convert each number back to a string and join them into a single string.\n\nSo, after sorting, I can do something like sortedNumbers.join('').\n\nPutting it all together, the function would look like:\n"], ["//From a supplied array of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each\n// other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).\n// >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])\n// [2.0, 2.2]\n// >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])\n// [2.0, 2.0]\nfunction find_closest_elements(numbers){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe have an array of numbers with at least two elements. We need to select two numbers that are closest to each other and return them in order, from smaller to larger. So, for example, in the first sample input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], the closest numbers are 2.0 and 2.2, so the output is [2.0, 2.2]. In the second example, [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], the closest are 2.0 and 2.0, so the output is [2.0, 2.0].\n\nSo, the approach is to find the pair of numbers in the array that have the smallest difference. How can I do this?\n\nFirst, I can sort the array. Once it's sorted, the closest numbers will be adjacent to each other. So, for example, in the first sample, after sorting, it's [1.0, 2.0, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]. The closest pairs are 2.0 and 2.2, which are adjacent.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the array in ascending order.\n2. Iterate through the sorted array, comparing each pair of adjacent elements.\n3. Keep track of the pair with the smallest difference.\n4. If there are multiple pairs with the same smallest difference, return the first one encountered.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the array is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]. After sorting, it becomes [1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]. The differences between 1.0 and 2.0 is 1.0, between 2.0 and 2.0 is 0.0, and between 2.0 and 3.0 is 1.0. So the smallest difference is 0.0, which occurs between the two 2.0s. So, the output is [2.0, 2.0].\n\nSo, the algorithm should find the pair with the smallest difference, and if there are multiple pairs with the same difference, return the first one.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum difference found so far and the pair of numbers.\n- Iterate through the sorted array, comparing each element with the next one.\n- For each pair, calculate the difference.\n- If the difference is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum and the pair.\n- If the difference is equal to the current minimum, do not update, because we need the first occurrence.\n- After processing all pairs, return the pair.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the pair 2.0 and 2.2 is the closest. So, the algorithm would find that.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nIn JavaScript, the function is given as:\n"], ["//Given array of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that array,\n// such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1\n// >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])\n// [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]\nfunction rescale_to_unit(numbers){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called rescale_to_unit that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where the smallest number is 0 and the largest is 1. The transformation should be linear.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], the output should be [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].\n\nHmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimum and maximum values of the input array. Once I have those, I can calculate the scaling factor for each number.\n\nThe formula for rescaling a number x is:\n\nscaled_x = (x - min) / (max - min)\n\nSo, for each element in the array, subtract the minimum, divide by the range (max - min), and that's the new value.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimum value in the array.\n2. Find the maximum value in the array.\n3. For each number in the array, compute (number - min) / (max - min).\n4. Return the new array with these scaled values.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, I can get the min and max using the Math.min and Math.max functions. But wait, what if the array is empty? Oh, the problem says the array has at least two elements, so I don't have to handle that case.\n\nSo, in the function:\n"], ["//Filter given array of any jsthon values only for integers\n// >>> filter_integers([\"a\", 3.14, 5])\n// [5]\n// >>> filter_integers([1, 2, 3, \"abc\", {}, []])\n// [1, 2, 3]\nfunction filter_integers(values){}\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to write a JavaScript function called filter_integers that takes an array of values and returns a new array containing only the integers. The function should exclude any elements that are not integers, including numbers that are not of type 'number' or those that are NaN.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes an integer in JavaScript. An integer is a number that is whole, without any fractional part. So, for example, 5 is an integer, but 5.0 is also considered an integer because it's equivalent to 5. However, 5.5 is not an integer.\n\nThe function needs to check each element in the input array and determine if it is an integer. If it is, include it in the output array. If it's not, exclude it.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the input array.\n2. For each element, check if it is an integer.\n3. If it is an integer, add it to the result array.\n4. Return the result array after processing all elements.\n\nNow, how do I check if an element is an integer in JavaScript?\n\nI can use the Number() function to convert the element to a number. Then, I can check if the number is equal to its integer version. But wait, what about cases where the element is a string that represents a number, like \"5\"? Converting it to a number would give 5, which is equal to its integer version, so it would be considered an integer.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the element is a boolean? Because in JavaScript, true is 1 and false is 0 when converted to numbers. So, for example, if the element is true, Number(true) is 1, which is an integer. But in the context of this problem, should true be considered as an integer? Looking back at the examples given, the function is supposed to filter out non-integer values. So, in the example given, [\"a\", 3.14, 5] returns [5], which suggests that 3.14 is not an integer. So, in the case of true, which is 1, would it be considered an integer?\n\nWait, let's think about the problem statement. It says, \"Filter given array of any jsthon values only for integers.\" So, perhaps the function should consider any value that is an integer, regardless of its type. So, for example, if the element is a boolean, it's not an integer because it's a boolean, not a number. But wait, in JavaScript, true is 1 and false is 0 when converted to numbers. So, if the element is a boolean, Number(element) would be 1 or 0, which are integers. But in the context of the problem, should boolean values be considered as integers?\n\nLooking at the examples provided:\n\nIn the first example, [\"a\", 3.14, 5] returns [5]. So, 3.14 is not an integer, and 5 is.\n\nIn the second example, [1, 2, 3, \"abc\", {} , [] ] returns [1, 2, 3]. So, the other elements are not integers.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should consider any element that is an integer, regardless of its type. So, for example, if the element is a boolean, it's not considered an integer because it's a boolean, not a number. But wait, in JavaScript, typeof true is 'boolean', so if the element is a boolean, Number(element) is 1 or 0, which are integers. So, perhaps the function should include elements that are integers, regardless of their type.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the examples include 3.14, which is a float, and 5, which is an integer. So, perhaps the function should consider any element that is an integer, regardless of its type.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should check if the element is an integer, regardless of its type. So, for example, if the element is a boolean, it's not considered an integer because it's a boolean, not a number. But if the element is a number, it's considered an integer.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, the typeof true is 'boolean', and typeof 1 is 'number'. So, perhaps the function should check if the element is an integer, regardless of its type. So, for example, if the element is a boolean, it's not considered an integer. But if it's"], ["//Return length of given string\n// >>> strlen(\"\")\n// 0\n// >>> strlen(\"abc\")\n// 3\nfunction strlen(string){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called strlen that takes a string as an argument and returns its length. But wait, the function is supposed to be called with a string, but in the examples, it's called with an empty string. So, I need to make sure that the function correctly returns the length of the input string.\n\nHmm, how do I get the length of a string in Python? Oh right, I can use the len() function. So, the function should take the string as an argument, then return len(string).\n\nWait, but in the examples, the function is called with an empty string, like strlen(\"\"), and the expected output is 0. So, the function should handle that correctly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function should be:\n\ndef strlen(string):\n    return len(string)\n\nYes, that should do it. Let me test it with the examples.\n\nFor strlen(\"\"), len(\"\") is 0, so the function returns 0. That's correct.\n\nFor strlen(\"abc\"), len(\"abc\") is 3, so the function returns 3. Correct.\n\nWhat about other cases, like strings with spaces or special characters? Well, the len() function should handle that correctly, so the function should be fine.\n\nI think that's all. So the code is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a Python function called `strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The length of a string in Python can be determined using the built-in `len()` function, which returns the number of characters in the string.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward:\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to write a function that returns the length of a given string. The string can be empty or contain any number of characters.\n2. **Use Built-in Function**: Python provides a built-in function `len()` which returns the length of a string. This function is efficient and handles all edge cases, including empty strings.\n3. **Implement the Function**: The function will take a single argument, the string, and return the length of this string using the `len()` function.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef strlen(string):\n    return len(string)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `strlen` is defined to take one parameter, `string`.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the length of the input string using `len(string)`.\n- **Handling Edge Cases**: The `len()` function correctly handles empty strings, strings with spaces, and any other characters, ensuring that the function works for all possible inputs.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is both efficient and easy to understand, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities to handle the string length calculation accurately."], ["//For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n\n// >>> largest_divisor(15)\n// 5\nfunction largest_divisor(n){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called largest_divisor that takes a number n and returns the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n. So for example, when n is 15, the function should return 5 because 5 is the largest number that divides 15 evenly and is smaller than 15.\n\nHmm, okay, so how do I approach this? Well, the problem is essentially asking for the largest proper divisor of n. A proper divisor is a divisor of a number excluding the number itself. So, for 15, the proper divisors are 1, 3, 5. The largest among these is 5.\n\nSo, how can I find the largest proper divisor of a number n? Let's think about the properties of divisors. The largest proper divisor of a number n is equal to n divided by its smallest prime factor. Because if you take the smallest prime factor, say p, then n/p will be the largest proper divisor.\n\nFor example, take n=15. The smallest prime factor is 3. So 15/3=5, which is the largest proper divisor.\n\nAnother example: n=12. The smallest prime factor is 2. So 12/2=6, which is the largest proper divisor.\n\nWait, but what about n=4? The smallest prime factor is 2. 4/2=2, which is the largest proper divisor.\n\nWhat about n=6? The smallest prime factor is 2. 6/2=3, which is the largest proper divisor.\n\nWait, but what about n=9? The smallest prime factor is 3. 9/3=3, which is the largest proper divisor.\n\nWait, but what about n=8? The smallest prime factor is 2. 8/2=4, which is the largest proper divisor.\n\nSo, the approach is: find the smallest prime factor of n, then divide n by that factor to get the largest proper divisor.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the smallest prime factor of n.\n\n2. Divide n by that factor to get the largest proper divisor.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the smallest prime factor of n.\n\nBut how do I find the smallest prime factor of a number in Python?\n\nWell, one approach is to check for divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of n. The first number that divides n is the smallest prime factor.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\nFunction largest_divisor(n):\n\n- If n is less than 2, return 0 or handle accordingly, but since n is given as a positive integer, perhaps n is at least 2.\n\n- Find the smallest prime factor of n.\n\n- Divide n by that factor to get the largest proper divisor.\n\nSo, the key is to find the smallest prime factor.\n\nLet's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for n=2, the smallest prime factor is 2. So 2/2=1, which is correct.\n\nFor n=3, smallest prime factor is 3. 3/3=1.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the smallest prime factor is 2. 4/2=2.\n\nWait, but for n=6, the smallest prime factor is 2. 6/2=3.\n\nWait, but for n=15, the smallest prime factor is 3. 15/3=5.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\ndef largest_divisor(n):\n\n    if n <= 1:\n\n        return 0  # since 1 has no proper divisors, and 0 is not a positive integer.\n\n    # find the smallest prime factor of n\n\n    smallest_prime = None\n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            smallest_prime = i\n\n            break\n\n    if smallest_prime is None:\n\n        # n is a prime number\n\n        return n - 1\n\n    else:\n\n        return n // smallest_prime\n\nWait, let's test this logic.\n\nTest case 1: n=15.\n\nLoop from 2 to sqrt(15) ~3.872, so up to 3.\n\nCheck 2: 15%2=1, no.\n\nCheck 3: 15%3=0, so smallest_prime is 3.\n\nReturn 15//3=5. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: n=12.\n\nLoop from 2 to sqrt(12) ~3.464, so up to 3.\n\nCheck 2: 12%2=0, so smallest_prime="], ["//Return array of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.\n// Each of the factors should be arrayed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.\n// Input number should be equal to the product of all factors\n// >>> factorize(8)\n// [2, 2, 2]\n// >>> factorize(25)\n// [5, 5]\n// >>> factorize(70)\n// [2, 5, 7]\nfunction factorize(n){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called factorize that takes an integer n and returns an array of its prime factors in order from smallest to largest. Each element in the array should appear as many times as it divides into n. For example, factorize(8) should return [2, 2, 2], and factorize(25) should return [5, 5]. Also, the product of all these factors should equal the original number n.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I need to do is find all the prime factors of n. How do I do that? Well, I remember that the process of finding prime factors involves dividing the number by the smallest possible prime numbers until you're left with 1.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n2. Check if 2 divides into n. If yes, divide n by 2 as many times as possible and add 2 to the factors array each time.\n3. Move to the next prime number, which is 3, and repeat the process.\n4. Continue this until the square of the current divisor is greater than n. If n is still greater than 1 after this, then it's a prime number itself and should be added to the factors array.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently find the next prime number? Because after checking 2, I need to check 3, then 5, then 7, and so on. So I can loop through odd numbers starting from 3.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Initialize an empty array to hold the factors.\n- Start with divisor = 2.\n- While divisor * divisor <= n:\n   - While n is divisible by divisor, add divisor to the factors array and divide n by divisor.\n   - Increment divisor by 1 (but only if it's even, since we've already checked 2).\n- After the loop, if n is greater than 1, it's a prime factor, so add it to the factors array.\n\nWait, but in the loop, after checking 2, I should increment the divisor by 1, but then check if it's even again. So perhaps after 2, I can set divisor to 3 and then increment by 2 each time to skip even numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can loop through all possible divisors starting from 2, but only check odd numbers after 2.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n"], ["//From an array of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n// Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n// >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n// [1, 3, 4]\nfunction remove_duplicates(numbers){ ... }\n\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called remove_duplicates that takes an array of integers and removes all elements that occur more than once, while keeping the order of the elements the same as in the input. So, for example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], the output should be [1, 3, 4]. \n\nHmm, how can I approach this? Well, I remember that in JavaScript, arrays have a method called `filter()`. Maybe I can use that to remove duplicates. But wait, the `filter()` method removes elements that don't meet a certain condition. So, I need to create a condition that checks if an element appears only once.\n\nBut how do I check if an element appears only once? Oh right, I can use the `Object.values()` method to get the counts of each element. Then, I can check if the length of the values is 1, which would mean the element appears only once. But wait, that might not work because for numbers, using `Object.values()` would treat them as keys, but since they are primitives, they might not be hashable. Oh, right, but in this case, the elements are integers, so they can be used as keys in an object.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, when you use `Object.keys()`, it returns an array of strings representing the keys. So, if I create an object where the keys are the elements of the array, and then check the length of the values, if it's 1, then the element occurs once. But wait, that's not correct because if the same element appears multiple times, the object will have only one key. So, for example, if the array is [2,2,2], the object will have one key: 2, and the value will be 3. So, the length of the values is 1, which would indicate that the element occurs once. But wait, in this case, the element occurs multiple times, but the object's value is the count. So, perhaps I can check if the length of the values is 1, but that's not sufficient because if the same element appears multiple times, the object's value is the count, but for elements that appear once, the value is 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the array is [1,2,3,2,4], the object would have keys 1,2,3,4 with values 1,1,1,1,1. So, the length of the values is 5, which is more than 1. So, the condition would be: if the length of the values is 1, then the element occurs once. But wait, that's not correct because if the same element appears multiple times, the object's value is the count, which is more than 1. So, the condition is: if the length of the values is 1, then the element occurs once. So, for the array [2,2,2], the object's values would be {2:3}, so the length is 1, which would indicate that the element occurs once. But in reality, the element occurs multiple times. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should not use the object method. Maybe I should use the `filter()` method with a condition that checks if the element occurs exactly once. But how can I do that?\n\nAnother approach is to sort the array and then remove duplicates. But that would not maintain the order, because sorting would change the order of elements. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but the problem says to keep the order of elements as in the input. So, I can't sort the array. So, I need a way to remove duplicates while preserving the order.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use a Set to track the elements I've already seen. Then, I can iterate through the array, and for each element, if it's not in the Set, I add it to the result array and add it to the Set. If it is in the Set, I skip it. That way, I can keep the order and remove duplicates.\n\nYes, that sounds like a plan. So, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize an empty Set to keep track of seen elements.\n2. Initialize an empty array to store the result.\n3. Iterate over each element in the input array:\n   a. For the current element, check if it's in the Set.\n   b. If it's not in the Set, add it to the result array and add it"], ["//For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.\n// >>> flip_case(\"Hello\")\n// \"hELLO\"\nfunction flip_case(string){ ... }\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that flips the case of each character in a given string. This means that all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase and all uppercase letters should be converted to lowercase.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward:\n1. **Iterate through each character** in the input string.\n2. **Check the case** of each character.\n3. **Convert the case** of each character to the opposite case.\n4. **Build the resulting string** by appending each converted character.\n\nThis approach ensures that each character is processed individually, making it easy to handle different cases efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```javascript"], ["//Concatenate array of strings into a single string\n// >>> concatenate([])\n// \"\"\n// >>> concatenate([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"])\n// \"abc\"\nfunction concatenate(strings){ ... }\n\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called concatenate that takes an array of strings and returns a single string. The examples given are:\n\n- concatenate([]) should return \"\"\n- concatenate([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]) should return \"abc\"\n\nSo, I need to think about how to concatenate an array of strings in Python.\n\nFirst, I should consider the case where the array is empty. In that case, the function should return an empty string. That's straightforward.\n\nFor the general case, I can loop through each string in the array and concatenate them together. Alternatively, I can use the string method in Python to concatenate all the strings at once.\n\nWait, in Python, the string method 'join' can be used. For example, ' '.join(strings) would join the strings with spaces in between. But in the examples, the output is just the concatenation without any separators. So, perhaps I should use the 'join' method without any separator.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The problem says to concatenate the array of strings into a single string. So, for [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], the output is \"abc\". So, the separator is not needed. So, the correct approach is to use the 'join' method with an empty string as the separator.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 'join' method in Python takes an iterable and a separator. So, 'join' can be called as 'strings'.join(separator). So, if I call 'strings'.join('') would give me the same as ''.join(strings), but with no separator. So, that's exactly what I need.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef concatenate(strings):\n    return ''.join(strings)\n\nWait, but what if the strings array is empty? Then ''.join(strings) would return an empty string, which is correct.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example: concatenate([]) should return \"\". Using the function, ''.join([]) is indeed \"\".\n\nSecond example: concatenate([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]) should return \"abc\". Using the function, ''.join([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]) is \"abc\".\n\nWhat about other cases? For example, strings with multiple elements, including empty strings.\n\nFor example, concatenate([\"a\", \"\", \"b\"]) should return \"ab\". Using the function, ''.join([\"a\", \"\", \"b\"]) is \"ab\".\n\nWhat about strings with different separators? For example, if the array is [\"hello\", \"world\"], then the function would return \"helloworld\", which is correct.\n\nSo, the function seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the strings array is not a list? Well, in Python, the function expects strings as an array, so it's assumed that the input is a list of strings.\n\nSo, the function should work as intended.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\ndef concatenate(strings):\n    return ''.join(strings)\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the function is called 'concatenate' and the examples show that the function returns a string. So, the code should be correct.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if the strings array contains other data types, like numbers or None? For example, concatenate([1, 2, 3]) would cause an error because you can't join integers. But according to the problem statement, the input is an array of strings, so we can assume that each element is a string.\n\nSo, the function is correct as written.\n\nAnother test case: concatenate([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]) should return \"abcd\".\n\nYes, the function returns that.\n\nSo, I think the function is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that takes an array of strings and returns a single concatenated string. The function should handle cases where the input array is empty and should correctly concatenate all strings in the array without any separators.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward. We can use Python's built-in string method `join` to concatenate all strings in the array. The `join` method takes an iterable and a separator string as arguments. By using an empty string as the separator, we ensure that there are no spaces or other characters between the concatenated strings. Additionally, if the input array is empty, the `join` method will naturally return an empty string, which is the correct behavior as specified in the problem statement.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef concatenate(strings):\n    return ''.join(strings)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `concatenate` is defined to take an argument `strings`, which is an array of strings.\n2. **String Joining**: Inside the function, we use the `join"], ["//Filter an input array of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.\n// >>> filter_by_prefix([], \"a\")\n// []\n// >>> filter_by_prefix([\"abc\", \"bcd\", \"cde\", \"array\"], \"a\")\n// [\"abc\", \"array\"]\nfunction filter_by_prefix(strings, prefix){}\n\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called filter_by_prefix that takes two arguments: an array of strings and a prefix. The function should return a new array containing only the strings that start with the given prefix.\n\nHmm, so for example, if the input array is [\"abc\", \"bcd\", \"cde\", \"array\"] and the prefix is \"a\", the output should be [\"abc\", \"array\"] because those are the only strings that start with \"a\".\n\nWait, but what about case sensitivity? The problem statement doesn't specify, so I think it's case-sensitive. So \"Apple\" wouldn't match \"apple\".\n\nSo, how do I approach this in Python?\n\nI remember that in Python, strings can be checked with the startswith() method. So for each string in the input array, I can check if it starts with the given prefix.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over each string in the input array.\n2. For each string, check if it starts with the prefix.\n3. If it does, include it in the resulting list.\n4. Return the resulting list.\n\nSo the function can be written using a list comprehension for efficiency.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nThe function is given as:\n\ndef filter_by_prefix(strings, prefix):\n    # code here\n\nSo, inside the function, I can create a new list by checking each string in 'strings' if it starts with 'prefix'.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nreturn [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]\n\nWait, that's it? That's a one-liner.\n\nBut wait, what if the strings are empty? Well, the startswith method will return False for empty strings, so it's handled.\n\nWhat about if the prefix is an empty string? Well, startswith(\"\") returns True for any string, so the function would return all strings. But according to the problem statement, the prefix is given, but it's not specified whether it can be empty. So perhaps the function should handle that case.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention that, so perhaps we can assume that the prefix is a non-empty string.\n\nSo, the code is simple.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nfilter_by_prefix([], \"a\") should return an empty list.\n\nfilter_by_prefix([\"abc\", \"bcd\", \"cde\", \"array\"], \"a\") should return [\"abc\", \"array\"].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef filter_by_prefix(strings, prefix):\n    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]\n\nThat's concise and efficient.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to filter an input array of strings to include only those strings that start with a given prefix. This can be efficiently achieved using Python's built-in string methods and list comprehensions.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves iterating over each string in the input array and checking if it starts with the given prefix. If a string starts with the prefix, it is included in the resulting list. This can be efficiently done using a list comprehension, which allows us to create a new list by including only the elements that meet the specified condition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef filter_by_prefix(strings, prefix):\n    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to filter strings based on a given prefix. This means we are looking for strings that start with the specified prefix.\n2. **Intuition**: Using the `startswith` method in Python allows us to check if a string begins with a given prefix efficiently.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input array. For each string, we check if it starts with the prefix using the `startswith` method. If it does, the string is included in the resulting list.\n4. **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient because it processes each string exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input array.\n\nThis solution is both concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities to handle the filtering operation."], ["//Return only positive numbers in the array.\n// >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])\n// [2, 5, 6]\n// >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n// [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]\nfunction get_positive(l){ ... }\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the positive numbers from the original array. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward:\n1. **Iterate through the array**: We will go through each element in the given array.\n2. **Check for positive numbers**: For each element, we will check if it is greater than zero.\n3. **Collect positive numbers**: If an element is positive, we will add it to a new array.\n4. **Return the new array**: After processing all elements, we will return the new array containing only the positive numbers.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently filter out only the positive numbers from the input array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```javascript"], ["//Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.\n// >>> is_prime(6)\n// false\n// >>> is_prime(101)\n// true\n// >>> is_prime(11)\n// true\n// >>> is_prime(13441)\n// true\n// >>> is_prime(61)\n// true\n// >>> is_prime(4)\n// false\n// >>> is_prime(1)\n// false\nfunction is_prime(n){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a function called is_prime that returns true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise. Let's see, I remember that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, for example, 2 is prime, 3 is prime, 4 is not because it's divisible by 2, and so on.\n\nFirst, I should handle the base cases. If n is less than 2, it's definitely not a prime. So, if n is 0, 1, or any negative number, the function should return false. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, for numbers greater than 2, I need to check if they have any divisors other than 1 and themselves. The standard approach is to check for divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of n. Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root, and we would have already found it.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. If n is less than 2, return false.\n2. Check if n is 2, which is prime, so return true.\n3. Check if n is even (divisible by 2), if so, return false because it's divisible by 2 and greater than 2.\n4. For odd numbers, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of n, stepping by 2 (since even divisors have already been checked).\n5. If any of these divisors divide n evenly, return false.\n6. If none of the divisors divide n evenly, return true.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, the function is_prime takes a parameter n. So, the function starts with:\n"], ["//This function takes an array l and returns an array l' such that\n// l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal\n// to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.\n// >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n// [1, 2, 3]\n// >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n// [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\nfunction sort_third(l){}\nTo solve this problem, I need to write a function called sort_third that takes an array l and returns an array l' such that:\n- The elements at indices not divisible by three remain the same as in l.\n- The elements at indices divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe function takes an array l and returns an array l' such that:\n- l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three.\n- Its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So, for the indices that are divisible by three, we take the values from l, sort them, and then place them back into l' at those indices.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample given:\n\nSample 1:\nInput: [1, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 3]\n\nBecause all indices (0, 1, 2) are divisible by three. So, the values at these indices are [1, 2, 3], which are sorted, but since all are in the same indices, the output remains the same.\n\nSample 2:\nInput: [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]\nOutput: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n\nLet's break this down.\n\nIndices of the input array (0-based):\n0: 5\n1: 6\n2: 3\n3:4\n4:8\n5:9\n6:2\n\nIndices divisible by 3: 0, 3, 6.\n\nSo, the values at these indices are 5,4,2.\n\nWe need to sort these values: 2,4,5.\n\nThen, place them back into the array at indices 0,3,6.\n\nSo, the new array becomes:\n\nIndex 0: 2\nIndex 1:6\nIndex 2:3\nIndex 3:4\nIndex 4:8\nIndex 5:9\nIndex 6:5\n\nWhich gives [2,6,3,4,8,9,5], which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Iterate through the original array and collect the elements at indices that are divisible by three.\n\n2. Sort these elements in ascending order.\n\n3. Replace the elements at these indices in the original array with the sorted elements.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- Create a list of elements from l where the index is divisible by 3.\n\n- Sort this list.\n\n- Create a new array where the elements at indices divisible by 3 are replaced with the sorted list.\n\n- Return this new array.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, we can loop through the array, collect the elements at indices divisible by 3.\n\nWe can do this by checking if (i % 3 === 0) for each index i.\n\nThen, collect these elements into an array.\n\nThen, sort this array.\n\nThen, create a new array where for each index i:\n\n- if i is divisible by 3, take the sorted element.\n\n- else, take the original element.\n\nSo, in code:\n"], ["//Return sorted unique elements in an array\n// >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n// [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]\nfunction unique(l){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I'm a bit stuck on this problem. So, I need to write a JavaScript function called unique that takes an array and returns a sorted, unique array of its elements. The example given is unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]) which returns [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]. So, the function needs to process the array, remove duplicates, sort them, and return the result.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, I think the first step is to process the array and remove duplicates. Then, sort the resulting array. So, maybe I can create a new array that contains only unique elements, and then sort that array.\n\nWait, but how do I remove duplicates? One way is to loop through the array and add each element to a new array only if it hasn't been added before. So, for example, for each element in the original array, if it's not already in the new array, add it. That way, duplicates are automatically removed.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a Set to keep track of the elements I've already added, and then convert the Set back to an array. But wait, Sets in JavaScript are unordered, so when I convert it back to an array, the order might not be preserved. But in the example, the output is sorted, so perhaps I need to sort the array after removing duplicates.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input array.\n2. For each element, check if it's already in a Set.\n3. If not, add it to the Set and also add it to a new array.\n4. After processing all elements, convert the Set to an array.\n5. Sort the array in ascending order.\n6. Return the sorted array.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, Sets are unordered, so when I convert it back to an array, the order might not be preserved. But in the example, the output is sorted, so perhaps I need to sort the array after removing duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a JavaScript object to track the elements, but that might be more complicated.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, create an empty Set and an empty array.\n\nThen, loop through each element in the input array:\n\nfor (let i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {\n    let element = l[i];\n    if (!set.has(element)) {\n        set.add(element);\n        result.push(element);\n    }\n}\n\nThen, after processing all elements, convert the Set to an array and sort it.\n\nBut wait, the Set is unordered, so when I convert it to an array, the order might not be preserved. So, perhaps I should convert it to an array and then sort it.\n\nSo, after the loop, I have:\n\nlet uniqueArray = Array.from(set);\n\nThen, sort uniqueArray.\n\nuniqueArray.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\nThen, return uniqueArray.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123], which is sorted. So, yes, after removing duplicates and converting to an array, I need to sort it.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n"], ["//Return maximum element in the array.\n// >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])\n// 3\n// >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n// 123\nfunction max_element(l){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called max_element that takes an array and returns the maximum element. Hmm, how do I do that?\n\nWell, I remember that in JavaScript, there's a built-in function called Math.max which can take an array and return the maximum value. So maybe I can just use that.\n\nWait, but what if the array is empty? Oh, right, the problem probably assumes that the array is non-empty. So I don't need to handle that case.\n\nSo the function can be as simple as returning Math.max(l). But wait, let me think about the examples given.\n\nIn the first example, max_element([1, 2, 3]) should return 3. Using Math.max([1,2,3]) gives 3, which is correct.\n\nIn the second example, the array is [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], and the max is 123. So Math.max should handle that correctly.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n"], ["//Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n// >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n// 0\n// >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n// 2\n// >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n// 3\nfunction fizz_buzz(n){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the question carefully.\n\nThe task is to return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n\nHmm, so for each integer less than n, I need to check two conditions: whether it's divisible by 11 or 13, and if it contains the digit 7. Then, count all such numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"divisible by 11 or 13\". So, any number that is divisible by either 11 or 13, and also has a 7 in its digits. So, for each number less than n, if it's divisible by 11 or 13, and has a 7 in it, then it contributes to the count.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Iterate through all integers from 1 to n-1 (since less than n).\n2. For each integer, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13.\n3. If it is, then check if it contains the digit 7.\n4. If both conditions are met, increment the count.\n\nBut wait, the function is called fizz_buzz, which is a classic problem. But in this case, the problem is a bit different. So, perhaps I should think about how to implement this.\n\nBut for larger n, say up to 1e6 or 1e7, this approach might be too slow. Because for each number, we have to check two conditions, which could take O(1) time, but for n up to 1e6, it's manageable. But for larger n, say 1e12, this approach would be too slow.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample inputs are small, so perhaps the function is intended to handle n up to 1e5 or 1e6.\n\nBut let's think about the constraints. The function is called fizz_buzz(n), and the sample inputs are 50, 78, 79. So, perhaps the function is intended to handle n up to 1e5 or 1e6.\n\nSo, the approach is to loop through each number from 1 to n-1, check if it's divisible by 11 or 13, and if it does, check if it has a 7 in any digit.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Initialize a count to 0.\n- For each number i from 1 to n-1:\n   - If i is divisible by 11 or 13:\n      - Convert i to a string.\n      - Check if '7' is in the string.\n      - If yes, increment count.\n- Return count.\n\nBut wait, for numbers that are divisible by both 11 and 13, we still need to check if they have a 7. So, the condition is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"divisible by 11 or 13\". So, if a number is divisible by both, it's still considered. So, the condition is correct.\n\nSo, the code would look something like this:\n"], ["//This function takes an array l and returns an array l' such that\n// l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n// to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n// >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n// [1, 2, 3]\n// >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n// [3, 6, 5, 4]\nfunction sort_even(l){}\nTo solve this problem, I need to write a function called sort_even that takes an array l and returns an array l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd indices, while its values at the even indices are equal to the values of the even indices of l, but sorted.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. So, the function needs to process the array and rearrange it in a specific way. The odd indices are the 0th, 2nd, 4th, etc., and the even indices are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. Wait, no, wait.

So, for n=1, it's 2; n=2, it's 3; n=3, it's 5; n=4, it's 13; n=5, it's 89.\n\nSo, the function needs to generate Fibonacci numbers, check if they are prime, and collect them in order until it has n such numbers, then return the n-th one.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate Fibonacci numbers in order.\n2. For each Fibonacci number, check if it is a prime.\n3. Collect these primes in a list until the list has n elements.\n4. Return the n-th element of this list.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n- Generate Fibonacci numbers until we have enough primes.\n- For each Fibonacci number, check if it's prime.\n- Collect the primes in order.\n- Return the n-th prime in this collection.\n\nNow, the challenge is to efficiently generate Fibonacci numbers and check for primality, especially for larger n.\n\nLet's think about the Fibonacci sequence. The first few Fibonacci numbers are:\n\nF(0) = 0\nF(1) = 1\nF(2) = 1\nF(3) = 2\nF(4) = 3\nF(5) = 5\nF(6) = 8\nF(7) = 13\nF(8) = 21\nF(9) = 34\nF(10) = 55\nF(11) = 89\nF(12) = 144\nF(13) = 233\nF(14) = 377\nF(15) = 610\nF(16) = 987\nF(17) = 1597\nF(18) = 2584\nF(19) = 4181\nF(20) = 6765\nF(21) = 10946\nF(22) = 17711\nF(23) = 28657\nF(24) = 46368\nF(25) = 75025\nF(26) = 121393\nF(27) = 196418\nF(28) = 317811\nF(29) = 514229\nF(30) = 832040\nF(31) = 1346269\nF(32) = 2178309\nF(33) = 3524578\nF(34) = 5702887\nF(35) = 9227465\nF(36) = 14930352\nF(37) = 24157817\nF(38) = 39088169\nF(39) = 63245986\nF(40) = 102334155\n"], ["//triples_sum_to_zero takes an array of integers as an input.\n// it returns true if there are three distinct elements in the array that\n// sum to zero, and false otherwise.\n// >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])\n// false\n// >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])\n// true\n// >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])\n// false\n// >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])\n// true\n// >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])\n// false\nfunction triples_sum_to_zero(l){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's see. The function is called triples_sum_to_zero and it takes an array of integers as input. It should return true if there are three distinct elements in the array that sum to zero, and false otherwise.\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to find three different elements in the array whose sum is zero. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should consider all possible triplets in the array and check if any of them sum to zero. But wait, the array can be large, so checking all possible triplets might be computationally expensive. But for the problem's constraints, maybe it's manageable.\n\nWait, but the problem is about integers, so perhaps there's a smarter way than checking all triplets. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach is to use a hash set to keep track of the elements we've already seen. For each element in the array, we can check if there are two other elements in the hash set that, when added to the current element, sum to zero. If such a pair exists, then we return true.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"three distinct elements.\" So the current element can't be one of the two others. So perhaps, for each element, we look for two other elements that are not the current element, and their sum is equal to the negative of the current element.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for each element x in the array, we can look for two elements y and z such that y + z = -x, and y and z are distinct and not equal to x.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate through each element x in the array.\n2. For each x, iterate through the remaining elements to find two elements y and z such that y + z = -x.\n3. If such a pair is found, return true.\n4. If after checking all elements no such pair is found, return false.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find y and z for each x?\n\nOne way is to use a hash set to store the elements we've already processed. For each x, we can look for elements in the hash set that sum to -x. But since we need two distinct elements, we can't just check for any element, but we need to find two elements that are not x and sum to -x.\n\nWait, but the hash set approach can be used to find if there are two elements that sum to a certain value. So for each x, we can compute target = -x, and then check if there are two elements in the hash set that sum to target. But we have to make sure that these two elements are not x, and also that they are distinct.\n\nWait, but the hash set approach can be used to find if there are two elements that sum to a certain value. So for each x, we can compute target = -x, and then check if the hash set contains at least two elements that sum to target. But we also need to ensure that these two elements are not x.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to structure it as follows:\n\n- For each x in the array:\n   - Create a new hash set (or a copy of the elements we've seen so far, excluding x)\n   - Check if there are two elements in this new hash set that sum to -x\n   - If yes, return true\n- If after all x's, no such pair is found, return false\n\nWait, but that might not be efficient because for each x, we have to create a new hash set, which could be O(n) for each x, leading to O(n^2) time.\n\nAlternatively, we can process the array and for each x, check the elements that have been processed before x. But that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a hash set that contains all elements except the current x, and then check if any two elements in the hash set sum to -x.\n\nBut that might not be efficient either.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to process the array in a way that for each x, we look for two elements in the array that are not x and sum to -x.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nWait"], ["//Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n// n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\n// are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n// each other.  All cars move in the same speed.

All cars have the same speed. The cars start very far apart, so initially, they don't collide. But as they move, they might eventually meet each other.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. Each car on the left is moving towards the right, and each car on the right is moving towards the left. So, for any car on the left and any car on the right, they will eventually meet if they are moving towards each other. But wait, no, because all cars are moving at the same speed. So, if a left-moving car is behind a right-moving car, they won't collide because they're moving in the same direction. Wait, no, that's not right. If a left-moving car is behind a right-moving car, the left-moving car is going to catch up to the right-moving car because they're moving towards each other. Wait, no, that's not correct. If both are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds. But since they have the same speed, their relative speed is 2v, where v is the speed. So, the time it takes for them to meet is the distance between them divided by 2v.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, all cars are moving at the same speed. So, the left-moving cars are moving to the right, and the right-moving cars are moving to the left. So, if a left-moving car is behind a right-moving car, the left-moving car is moving towards the right, and the right-moving car is moving towards the left. So, they are moving towards each other. So, they will collide.\n\nWait, but if a left-moving car is in front of a right-moving car, the left-moving car is moving to the right, and the right-moving car is moving to the left. So, they are moving away from each other. So, they won't collide.\n\nSo, the only way for a collision to happen is if a left-moving car is behind a right-moving car. Because then, the left-moving car is moving towards the right, and the right-moving car is moving towards the left, so they will meet somewhere in between.\n\nSo, the number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs where a left-moving car is behind a right-moving car.\n\nWait, but how are the cars arranged initially? The problem says that the two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. So, all the left-moving cars are on one side, and all the right-moving cars are on the other side, but they are all very far apart.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the two sets of cars are moving towards each other. So, the left-moving cars are moving to the right, and the right-moving cars are moving to the left. So, the left-moving cars are moving towards the right, and the right-moving cars are moving towards the left. So, the left-moving cars are moving away from the right-moving cars, but the right-moving cars are moving away from the left-moving cars.\n\nWait, no. If a left-moving car is moving to the right, and a right-moving car is moving to the left, then they are moving towards each other. So, they will collide.\n\nSo, the number of collisions is equal to the number of left-moving cars that are behind right-moving cars.\n\nBut how are the cars arranged initially? The problem says that the two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. So, all the left-moving cars are on one side, and all the right-moving cars are on the other side, but they are all very far apart.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the order of the cars. So, perhaps the left-moving cars are all on the left side, and the right-moving cars are all on the right side, but their order is arbitrary.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the two sets of cars are moving towards each other. So, perhaps the left-moving cars are on the left side, and the right-moving cars are on the right side, but their order is such that the left-moving cars are all to the left of the right-moving cars.\n\n"], ["//Return array with elements incremented by 1.\n// >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])\n// [2, 3, 4]\n// >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n// [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]\nfunction incr_list(l){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called incr_list that takes an array and increments each element by 1.

The second example is a longer array, and each element is also incremented by 1.\n\nSo the function needs to loop through each element in the input array and add 1 to each. Then return the new array.\n\nHow do I do that in JavaScript? Well, I can create a new array and push each element incremented by 1.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the map function. Because map takes a function and applies it to each element of the array. So I can create a function that adds 1 to a number and then use map on the input array.\n\nYes, that sounds efficient.

Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to check all possible pairs of distinct elements in the array and see if any of them add up to zero. If I find such a pair, I return true. If I go through the entire array and don't find any such pair, I return false.\n\nBut wait, checking all possible pairs might be inefficient, especially for large arrays. However, for the problem's constraints, maybe it's acceptable. But perhaps there's a smarter way to do this.\n\nWait, another approach: for each element in the array, check if there exists another element that is equal to its negative. Because if two elements are negatives of each other, their sum is zero.\n\nSo, for example, in the array [1, 3, -2, 1], the elements 3 and -3 would sum to zero, but in this case, there's no -3. So the function returns false.\n\nIn the array [2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7], let's see: 2 and -2? No. 4 and -4? No. -5 and 5? Yes, because 5 is present. So 5 and -5 sum to zero. So the function returns true.\n\nSo, the idea is to iterate through each element and check if its negative exists in the array. But we have to be careful about duplicates.\n\nWait, but if the array has duplicates, like [1, -1, 2], then 1 and -1 would sum to zero. So in this case, the function should return true.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Create a set of the array elements for O(1) lookups.\n\n2. Iterate through each element in the array.\n\n3. For each element, check if its negative is present in the set.\n\n4. If yes, return true.\n\n5. If after checking all elements no such pair is found, return false.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the same element appears multiple times? For example, [1, 1, -1]. Then, the first 1 and the -1 would form a pair, so the function should return true.\n\nSo, the approach should work because when we check the first 1, we look for -1 in the set, which includes the second 1 and the third element. So, it will find a match.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Convert the array into a set.\n\n- For each element in the array:\n\n   - Check if the negative of that element is in the set.\n\n   - If yes, return true.\n\n- After all elements are checked, return false.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the same element appears multiple times? For example, [0, 0]. Then, the first 0 is checked, and the set includes the second 0. So, it will return true.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1, 3, 5, 0]. The set is {1,3,5,0}. For each element:\n\n1: check if -1 is in the set? No.\n\n3: check if -3 is in the set? No.\n\n5: check if -5 is in the set? No.\n\n0: check if -0 is in the set? Yes, because -0 is 0. So, 0 is in the set. So, the function returns true.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the function returns false. Wait, let me check the sample input.\n\nWait, the first sample input is [1, 3, 5, 0], and the function returns false. But according to the approach, 0 is in the set, and -0 is 0, which is in the set. So, the function would return true, but the sample expects false.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, why? Because the function is supposed to"], ["//Change numerical base of input number x to base.\n// return string representation after the conversion.\n// base numbers are less than 10.\n// >>> change_base(8, 3)\n// \"22\"\n// >>> change_base(8, 2)\n// \"1000\"\n// >>> change_base(7, 2)\n// \"111\"\nfunction change_base(x, base){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called change_base that converts a given number x from base 10 to another base, which is less than 10. The function should return the string representation of this converted number.\n\nHmm, okay, so for example, when x is 8 and base is 3, the output is \"22\". Let me think about how that works. 8 in base 3 is 2*3 + 2, which is 22. Similarly, 8 in base 2 is 1000 because 8 is 2^3, which is 1 followed by three zeros.\n\nSo, the general approach is to repeatedly divide the number by the base and collect the remainders. These remainders, read in reverse order, give the number in the new base.\n\nWait, but what about when the number is zero? Well, in that case, the function should return \"0\". But looking at the examples, the function is called with x as 8, which is non-zero, so I don't have to handle that case.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Handle the case where x is 0. Return \"0\".\n2. For other cases, repeatedly divide x by the base and collect the remainders.\n3. Once all remainders are collected, reverse them to get the correct order.\n4. Convert each remainder to its corresponding character (since base numbers are less than 10, each digit is a single character, like 0-9).\n5. Combine these characters into a string and return it.\n\nWait, but what about when the number is negative? The examples don't include negative numbers, but the function's description says \"change numerical base of input number x\". So, I should assume that x is a non-negative integer. Or perhaps, the function should handle negative numbers as well. Hmm, but the examples don't cover that. So, perhaps the function is intended to work with non-negative integers only.\n\nSo, let's proceed under the assumption that x is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, the algorithm:\n\n- If x is 0, return \"0\".\n- Else, while x > 0:\n   - remainder = x % base\n   - append the character corresponding to remainder (chr(remainder + ord('0')))\n   - x = x // base\n- Reverse the collected remainders to get the correct order.\n- Join the characters and return as a string.\n\nWait, but in the example change_base(8,3), the remainders are 2 and 2, so the string is \"22\". So, the remainders are collected in the order of least significant digit first, so when we reverse, we get the correct order.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor x=8, base=3:\n\n8 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 2. So, first remainder is 2.\n\nThen, 2 divided by 3 is 0 with remainder 2. So, second remainder is 2.\n\nSo, the remainders collected are [2, 2]. Then, we reverse them to get [2,2], which is \"22\".\n\nAnother example: x=8, base=2.\n\n8 divided by 2 is 4, remainder 0.\n\n4 divided by 2 is 2, remainder 0.\n\n2 divided by 2 is 1, remainder 0.\n\n1 divided by 2 is 0, remainder 1.\n\nSo, remainders collected are [0,0,0,1]. Then, reverse to get [1,0,0,0], which is \"1000\".\n\nSo, the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, handle the case where x is 0: return \"0\".\n\nElse, create a list to collect the remainders.\n\nLoop while x > 0:\n\n   remainder = x % base\n\n   append str(remainder) to the list.\n\n   x = x // base\n\nThen, reverse the list, and join into a string.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the remainders are 2 and 2, so the list is [2,2], reversed is [2,2], which is correct.\n\nIn the second example, the remainders are 0,0,0,1, so the list is [0,0,0,1], reversed is [1,0,0,0], which is correct.\n\nSo, the code"], ["//Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.\n// >>> triangle_area(5, 3)\n// 7.5\nfunction triangle_area(a, h){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called triangle_area that takes two arguments: a and h. a is the length of a side, and h is the corresponding height (altitude) of the triangle. The function should return the area of the triangle.\n\nWait, but wait a second. I remember that the area of a triangle is generally calculated as (base * height) / 2. So in this case, the base is 'a' and the height is 'h'. So the area should be (a * h) / 2.\n\nBut wait, is that always the case?

Is there any case where this formula doesn't hold? For example, if the given side is not the base, but the height is not the perpendicular height. But in the problem statement, it says that h is the corresponding height. So, h is the height relative to the base 'a'. So, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the function is correct.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\ndef triangle_area(a, h):\n    return (a * h) / 2\n\nBut wait, in Python, the division operator / returns a float.

Here, the base is the length of one side of the triangle, and the height is the perpendicular distance from this base to the opposite vertex.\n2. **Input Parameters**: The function takes two parameters, `a` (length of the side) and `h` (height corresponding to the side).\n3. **Calculate Area**: Using the formula, compute the area by multiplying `a` and `h`, then dividing the result by 2.\n4. **Return the Result**: The computed area is returned as the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef triangle_area(a, h):\n    return (a * h) / 2\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe function `triangle_area` takes two arguments, `a` and `h`, which represent the length of a side and the corresponding height of the triangle, respectively.

Let's see, the Fib4 sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with a longer recurrence relation. The definition is:\n\nfib4(0) = 0\nfib4(1) = 0\nfib4(2) = 2\nfib4(3) = 0\nfib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4) for n >=4\n\nSo, for n >=4, each term is the sum of the previous four terms.\n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently. Since the function is called recursively, but we can't use recursion, we need to find an iterative approach.\n\nLet's think about how to compute this iteratively. We can start from the base cases and build up the sequence step by step until we reach the desired n.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Handle the base cases directly.

So i=4.\n\nnext_val = a + b + c + d = 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nThen, a becomes b (0), b becomes c (2), c becomes d (0), d becomes next_val (2).\n\nSo after the loop, d is 2, which is correct.\n\nFor n=5:\n\nLoop runs from 4 to 5.\n\ni=4: next_val = 0+0+2+0=2. a=0, b=2, c=0, d=2.\n\ni=5: next_val = 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 =4. a=2, b=0, c=2, d=4.\n\nSo return d=4, correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nLoop runs for i=4,5,6.\n\ni=4: next_val=0+0+2+0=2. a=0, b=2, c=0, d=2.\n\ni=5: next"], ["//Return median of elements in the array l.\n// >>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])\n// 3\n// >>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])\n// 15.0\nfunction median(l){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called median that takes an array l and returns its median. The median is the middle value when the elements are sorted. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If it's odd, it's the middle number.\n\nSo, first, I need to sort the array. How do I do that in JavaScript? Oh right, the sort() method. But wait, I should make sure that the sort is in place or not. Oh, right, sort() sorts the array in place, so I can just call l.sort(). But wait, what about the initial array? I think it's okay because I'm modifying it.\n\nWait, but what if the array is empty? Oh, but the problem probably expects that the input array has at least one element. Or maybe I should handle that case. But the examples given have at least one element, so perhaps I don't need to handle that. But in code, I should probably check if the array is empty and return 0 or something. But the problem says to return the median, so perhaps the function is called with a valid array.\n\nSo, step 1: sort the array.\n\nThen, find the middle index. How? The length of the array is n. If n is odd, the middle index is Math.floor(n / 2). If n is even, it's n / 2, but since we need to take the two middle numbers, perhaps it's better to handle both cases.\n\nWait, for example, if the array has 5 elements, the middle is at index 2 (0-based). So, for n elements, the middle index is Math.floor((n - 1) / 2). Let me see:\n\nn = 5: (5-1)/2 = 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nn = 4: (4-1)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 Math.floor is 1. So, the two middle elements are at indices 1 and 2.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Find the length n.\n\n- If n is odd, the median is the element at index Math.floor((n-1)/2).\n\n- If n is even, the median is the average of the elements at indices Math.floor(n/2 - 1) and Math.floor(n/2).\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nFor n=5:\n\nIndices 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nMiddle index is 2.\n\nFor n=4:\n\nIndices 0,1,2,3.\n\nMiddle indices are 1 and 2.\n\nSo, for even n, the two middle indices are (n/2 -1) and (n/2).

Vowels are a, e, i, o, u, both lowercase and uppercase. So, I need to check each character in the input string and include it in the output only if it is not a vowel.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, I can check if it is a vowel by seeing if it is in the set {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}. Alternatively, I can convert the character to lowercase and check against lowercase vowels, but that might be less efficient. However, for the sake of simplicity, perhaps checking both cases is better.\n\nWait, but in Python, checking if a character is in a string is straightforward. So, for each character in the input string, I can check if it is in the set of vowels. If it is not, I include it in the result.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize an empty string to build the result.\n2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, regardless of case).\n4. If it is not a vowel, append it to the result string.\n5. After processing all characters, return the result string.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe function is called remove_vowels and takes text as a parameter.\n\nSo, inside the function:\n\nInitialize result as an empty string.\n\nLoop through each char in text:\n\nif char not in {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}, then append to result.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert the character to lowercase and check if it is in the lowercase vowels set.\n\nBut perhaps the first approach is easier to write.\n\nWait, but in Python, checking if a character is in a string is O(n), but for a small set, it's manageable.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef remove_vowels(text):\n    result = \"\"\n    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}\n    for char in text:\n        if char not in vowels:\n            result += char\n    return result\n\nWait, but that's a bit repetitive. Alternatively, I can create a set of vowels and check if the character is in that set.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a set of lowercase vowels and check if the lowercase version of the character is in that set.\n\nSo, another approach:\n\nvowels_lower = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}\nfor char in text:\n    if char.lower() not in vowels_lower:\n        result += char\n\nThis might be more efficient, as it avoids checking both lowercase and uppercase.\n\nBut for the problem, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, let's implement that.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef remove_vowels(text):\n    result = []\n    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}\n    for char in text:\n        if char not in vowels:\n            result.append(char)\n    return ''.join(result)\n\nAlternatively, using the lowercase approach:\n\ndef remove_vowels(text):\n    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}\n    result = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.lower() not in vowels:\n            result.append(char)\n    return ''.join(result)\n\nEither way should work.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nExample 1: remove_vowels(\"\") should return \"\".\n\nYes, because the loop doesn't run, and result is empty.\n\nExample 2: remove_vowels(\"abcdef\") should return \"bcdf\".\n\nYes, because 'a' is a vowel, 'b' is not, 'c' is not, 'd' is not, 'e' is a vowel, 'f' is not. So the result is 'bcdf'.\n\nExample 3: remove_vowels(\"aaaaa\") should return \"\".\n\nYes, because all are vowels.\n\nExample 4: remove_vowels(\"aaBAA"], ["//Return true if all numbers in the array l are below threshold t.\n// >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)\n// true\n// >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)\n// false\nfunction below_threshold(l, t){ ... }\n\nOkay, I need to write a function called below_threshold that takes an array l and a number t, and returns true if all numbers in the array l are below threshold t. Otherwise, returns false.\n\nHmm, so for example, in the first test case, [1, 2, 4, 10], all numbers are below 100, so it returns true. In the second test case, [1, 20, 4, 10], 20 is equal to 20, but the threshold is 5, so 20 is above 5, so it returns false.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the function is called below_threshold, and the second test case is [1, 20, 4, 10], t is 5. So 20 is above 5, so the function should return false.\n\nSo the function needs to check each element in the array l and ensure that each element is less than t.\n\nSo, how to do that in JavaScript.\n\nWell, the function is given l and t. So, for each number in l, we need to check if it is less than t.\n\nSo, perhaps, we can loop through each element in l, and for each element, check if it is less than t. If any element is not less than t, return false. Otherwise, after checking all elements, return true.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Array.prototype.every() method, which returns true if all elements of the array pass a test. So, for each element in l, we can test if it is less than t.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n"], ["//Add two numbers x and y\n// >>> add(2, 3)\n// 5\n// >>> add(5, 7)\n// 12\nfunction add(x, y){ ... }\n</think>\n\nTo add two numbers, you can create a function that takes two parameters, x and y, and returns their sum.

So, for example, \"eabcdzzzz\" and \"dddzzzzzzzddeddabc\" should return True because they have the same characters with the same counts. But \"abcd\" and \"dddddddabc\" should return True because they have the same characters, just with different counts. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the examples, same_chars(\"eabcdzzzz\", \"dddzzzzzzzddeddabc\") returns true. Let me see: \"eabcdzzzz\" has e, a, b, c, d, z, z, z, z. So that's e, a, b, c, d, z (4 times). The other string is \"dddzzzzzzzddeddabc\". Let's count the letters: d, d, d, z, z, z, z, z, z, z, d, d, e, d, a, b, c. Wait, that's 15 letters. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Or perhaps the function is supposed to return True if the two strings have the same characters, regardless of the order, but considering the counts. So, the function should return True if the two strings have the same multiset of characters.\n\nSo, the approach is to count the frequency of each character in both strings and check if the frequency distributions are the same.\n\nSo, how to do that in Python.\n\nOne way is to use the collections.Counter class. So, for each string, create a Counter object, which will give a dictionary-like object where the keys are the characters and the values are their counts.\n\nThen, compare the two Counters. If they are equal, return True; else, return False.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef same_chars(s0, s1):\n    return Counter(s0) == Counter(s1)\n\nWait, but wait.

Hmm, I remember that the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, but sometimes people index it starting from 1.

So perhaps the function is 1-based, meaning fib(1) is 1, fib(2) is 1, fib(3) is 2, etc.\n\nSo, the function needs to return the n-th term in this 1-based Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo, for n=1, return 1; n=2, return 1; n=3, return 2; n=4, return 3; n=5, return 5, etc.\n\nSo, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nI can think of two approaches: iterative and recursive. But for larger n, recursion might be too slow because of the repeated calculations.\n\nSo, perhaps an iterative approach is better.\n\nLet me think about the iterative method.\n\nWe can initialize two variables, a and b, which represent the (n-2)th and (n-1)th terms, respectively. Then, for each step from 3 to n, we compute the next term as a + b, and update a and b accordingly.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=1, return 1.\n\nn=2, return 1.\n\nn=3: a=1, b=1. a + b = 2.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty stack**: This stack will be used to keep track of the opening brackets as we iterate through the string.\n2. **Iterate through each character in the string**: For each character:\n   - If the character is an opening bracket ('<'), push it onto the stack.\n   - If the character is a closing bracket ('>'), check if there is an opening bracket in the stack. If there is, pop the top element from the stack and continue. If there is no matching opening bracket, the sequence is invalid.\n3. **Check the stack at the end**: After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has been matched with a closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets, making the sequence invalid.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for valid bracket sequences in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```javascript"], ["//Return true is array elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.\n// >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])\n// true\n// >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])\n// false\n// >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])\n// true\nfunction monotonic(l){ ... }\nSo, I need to write a function called monotonic that returns true if the array elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

So, in that case, it should return true.\n\nSo, the function should return true if the array is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nSo, the function needs to check whether the array is non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nSo, how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for a given array, we can check whether it is non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nIf it is non-decreasing, return true.\n\nIf it is non-increasing, return true.\n\nElse, return false.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\nif (isMonotonicNonDecreasing(l) || isMonotonicNonIncreasing(l)) return true.\n\nElse, return false.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to writing two helper functions: one to check if the array is non-decreasing, and another to check if it is non-increasing.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can combine these checks.\n\nAlternatively, we can write a single function that checks whether the array is either non-decreasing or non-increasing.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement isMonotonicNonDecreasing.\n\nAn array is non-decreasing if for every i < j, l[i] <= l[j].\n\nSimilarly, it is non-increasing if for every i < j, l[i] >= l[j].\n\nSo, for the function, we can first check whether the array is non-decreasing. If yes, return true.\n\nElse, check whether it is non-increasing. If yes, return true.\n\nElse, return false.\n\nSo, the function can be implemented as:\n"], ["//Return sorted unique common elements for two arrays.\n// >>> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])\n// [1, 5, 653]\n// >>> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])\n// [2, 3]\nfunction common(l1, l2){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a function called common that takes two arrays, l1 and l2, and returns a sorted unique common elements. The output should be an array of the common elements, sorted in ascending order, and without duplicates. So, for example, in the first sample, the common elements are 1, 5, and 653, which are sorted.\n\nHmm, so how do I approach this? Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the elements that are present in both l1 and l2. Then, I need to ensure that each element is unique and that the resulting array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the intersection of the two arrays. That is, elements that are present in both.\n2. Remove duplicates from this intersection.\n3. Sort the resulting array in ascending order.\n4. Return this sorted array.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the intersection of two arrays? Because arrays can have duplicates, but the problem says to return unique common elements. So, for example, if l1 has [1, 1, 2] and l2 has [1, 2, 2], the common elements are 1 and 2.\n\nSo, the first thing is to find the set of elements in l1 and l2, then find the intersection of these sets.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, step 1: create a set from l1 and a set from l2. Then, find the intersection of these two sets. That will give me the unique common elements.\n\nOnce I have the intersection, I need to sort them in ascending order.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Convert l1 and l2 into sets.\n- Find the intersection of these two sets.\n- Convert the resulting set back into an array.\n- Sort this array in ascending order.\n- Return the sorted array.\n\nWait, but what about the order? Because the original arrays might have elements in any order, but the output needs to be sorted.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n1. Create a set for l1: set1 = new Set(l1)\n2. Create a set for l2: set2 = new Set(l2)\n3. Find the intersection: commonElements = new Set([...]). Wait, no. Wait, in JavaScript, the Set object doesn't have an intersection method. So, I need to find the elements that are present in both sets.\n\nSo, I can loop through each element in set1 and check if it exists in set2. Alternatively, I can use the .filter() method.\n\nYes, for example:\n\nlet common = new Set([...]);\ncommon = new Set([...]).filter(x => set2.has(x));\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, the Set object doesn't have a filter method. So, I need to loop through each element in set1 and check if it's in set2.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the .includes() method.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nlet common = new Set();\nfor (let num of set1) {\n    if (set2.has(num)) {\n        common.add(num);\n    }\n}\n\nYes, that would work.\n\nOnce I have the common elements, I need to sort them in ascending order.\n\nSo, I can convert the Set to an array and then sort it.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n"], ["//Return the largest prime factor of n.

The function should assume that n is greater than 1 and is not a prime. So, for example, when n is 13195, the function should return 29, and when n is 2048, it should return 2.\n\nHmm, I remember that to find the largest prime factor of a number, one approach is to divide the number by the smallest possible primes and keep track of the largest one found. But I'm not sure how to implement that efficiently.\n\nWait, maybe I can use trial division. The idea is to try dividing n by all primes starting from 2 up to the square root of n. The largest prime factor will be the largest prime that divides n without a remainder.\n\nBut how do I implement this? Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find all the prime factors of n. Then, among those factors, find the largest one.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize the largest prime factor as 2.\n2. Check if 2 divides n. If yes, set the largest prime factor to 2 and divide n by 2 as much as possible.\n3. Then, check odd numbers starting from 3 up to sqrt(n). For each odd number, check if it divides n. If it does, set the largest prime factor to that number and divide n by this number as much as possible.\n4. After processing all possible divisors up to sqrt(n), if the remaining n is greater than 1, it must be a prime factor itself, so set the largest prime factor to that.\n\nWait, but this approach might not be efficient for very large n. But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code.\n\nInitialize largest_prime as 2.\n\nIf n is even, then 2 is a prime factor. So, we can divide n by 2 until it's no longer divisible by 2. Then, the largest prime factor is at least 2.\n\nThen, for i from 3 to sqrt(n), step 2 (since we're only checking odd numbers):\n\nFor each i, if i divides n, then set largest_prime to i and divide n by i as much as possible. Then, continue.\n\nAfter the loop, if n is greater than 1, it's a prime factor, so set largest_prime to n.\n\nWait, but this might not capture all the prime factors correctly. For example, if n is 2048, which is 2^11, then after dividing by 2, n becomes 1, so the loop doesn't run, and the largest_prime remains 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=13195. Let's see:\n\n13195 is odd, so 2 doesn't divide it. So, largest_prime remains 2.\n\nThen, we check i from 3 up to sqrt(13195) which is about 114.8.\n\nWe check i=3: 13195 divided by 3 is 4398.333... so no.\n\ni=5: 13195 divided by 5 is 2639. So, largest_prime becomes 5, and we divide 13195 by 5 as much as possible. Wait, but 13195 /5 is 2639, which is still divisible by 5? Let's see: 2639 divided by 5 is 527.8, so no. So, after dividing by 5 once, n becomes 2639.\n\nThen, we continue checking i=7: 2639 divided by 7 is 377, so 7 is a factor. So, largest_prime becomes 7, and we divide 2639 by 7 to get 377.\n\nThen, i=9: 377 divided by 9 is 41.888..., so no.\n\ni=11: 377 divided by 11 is 34.272..., no.\n\ni=13: 377 divided by 13 is 29, so yes. So, largest_prime becomes 13, and we divide 377 by 13 to get 29.\n\nNow, i increases to 15, but 15"], ["//sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n// >>> sum_to_n(30)\n// 465\n// >>> sum_to_n(100)\n// 5050\n// >>> sum_to_n(5)\n// 15\n// >>> sum_to_n(10)\n// 55\n// >>> sum_to_n(1)\n// 1\nfunction sum_to_n(n){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called sum_to_n that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to n. Hmm, how do I calculate that?\n\nWait, I remember there's a formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. It's n*(n+1)/2. Oh right, that's much more efficient than adding each number individually, especially for large n.\n\nSo, the function should take n as an argument, compute n*(n+1)//2, and return that value. But wait, what if n is zero or negative? Oh, the problem says it's a function that sums numbers from 1 to n, so n should be a positive integer. But perhaps the function should handle cases where n is zero or negative by returning 0 or raising an error. But looking at the examples, the function is called with positive integers, so maybe we can assume n is a positive integer.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef sum_to_n(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nWait, but in Python, integer division can be done with // or using the / operator and converting to int. So, using // is better to avoid floating points.\n\nLet me test this with the examples:\n\nsum_to_n(30) should return 465. Let's compute 30*31/2 = 930/2 = 465. Correct.\n\nsum_to_n(100) is 5050. 100*101/2 = 5050. Correct.\n\nsum_to_n(5) is 15. 5*6/2=15. Correct.\n\nsum_to_n(1) is 1. 1*2/2=1. Correct.\n\nsum_to_n(10) is 55. 10*11/2=55. Correct.\n\nSo, the function should work.\n\nWait, but what if n is zero? sum_to_n(0) would be 0*(1)/2=0. But according to the problem statement, it's summing from 1 to n, so n=0 would imply summing from 1 to 0, which is zero. So, the function returns 0 in that case.\n\nBut the problem examples don't include n=0, so perhaps the function is intended to handle n >=1.\n\nSo, the function is correct as written.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number \\( n \\). This can be efficiently done using a mathematical formula rather than iterating through each number, which ensures optimal performance even for large values of \\( n \\).\n\n### Approach\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\]\nThis formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula and provides a direct computation without the need for loops or additional data structures.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef sum_to_n(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Formula Application**: The function uses the formula \\( \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\) to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This formula is efficient and runs in constant time \\( O(1) \\), making it suitable for very large values of \\( n \\).\n2. **Integer Division**: To ensure the result is an integer, we use integer division (//) which automatically handles the division and truncates any fractional part.\n3. **Efficiency**: This approach is optimal because it avoids the need for loops or additional data structures, making it both time and space efficient.\n\nBy using this approach, we ensure that the function is both efficient and easy to understand, providing the correct sum for any positive integer \\( n \\)."], ["//brackets is a string of \"(\" and \")\".\n// return true if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n// >>> correct_bracketing(\"(\")\n// false\n// >>> correct_bracketing(\"()\")\n// true\n// >>> correct_bracketing(\"(()())\")\n// true\n// >>> correct_bracketing(\")(()\")\n// false\nfunction correct_bracketing(brackets){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a function called correct_bracketing that takes a string of parentheses and returns true if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Hmm, how can I approach this?\n\nI remember that a common way to check for balanced parentheses is to use a stack. The idea is to iterate through each character in the string, and for every opening bracket '(', push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket ')', we check if the stack is not empty. If it's not empty, we pop the top element and continue. If the stack is empty, that means there's an unmatched closing bracket, so we return false.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the string is empty? Like, if brackets is an empty string, then it's considered balanced, right? So in that case, we should return true.\n\nLet me think about the examples given:\n\n1. correct_bracketing(\"(\") returns false. Because there's only one opening bracket without a closing one.\n2. correct_bracketing(\"()\") returns true. The stack would push '(', then pop it when we see ')'.\n3. correct_bracketing(\"(()())\") returns true. The stack would handle each pair correctly.\n4. correct_bracketing(\")(())\" returns false. The first character is ')', which would cause the stack to be empty, so we return false.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize an empty stack.\n- Iterate over each character in the brackets string.\n- For each character:\n   - If it's '(', push onto the stack.\n   - If it's ')':\n      - If the stack is empty, return false.\n      - Pop the top element from the stack.\n- After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return true; else, return false.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is empty? The stack would be empty, so it returns true, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"(()\" would have a stack that's not empty after processing, so it returns false.\n\nSo, the function should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nThe function is called correct_bracketing and takes brackets as a parameter.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1.

The derivative of a constant is zero, so it's not included in the result. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate over each coefficient in the input array.\n2. For each coefficient, if it's not the first element (i=0), multiply it by its index (i) to get the new coefficient for x^(i-1).\n3. Collect all these new coefficients into a new array.\n4. Return this new array as the derivative.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFirst example: derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]) should return [1, 4, 12, 20].\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The input is [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]. So, the coefficients are 3 (x^0), 1 (x^1), 2 (x^2), 4 (x^3), 5 (x^4).\n\n- The derivative is computed as:\n\nFor each term except the first (i=0):\n\n- i=1: 1 * 1 = 1 \u2192 x^0 \u2192 coefficient 1.\n- i=2: 2 * 2 = 4 \u2192 x^1 \u2192 coefficient 4.\n- i=3: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 x^2 \u2192 coefficient 12.\n- i=4: 5 * 4 = 20 \u2192 x^3 \u2192 coefficient 20.\n\nSo the derivative is [1,4,12,20], which matches the example.\n\nSecond example: derivative([1, 2, 3]) should return [2,6].\n\nLet's compute:\n\n- i=1: 2 * 1 = 2 \u2192 x^0 \u2192 coefficient 2.\n- i=2: 3 * 2 = 6 \u2192 x^1 \u2192 coefficient 6.\n\nSo the derivative is [2,6], which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if the input is [5]? Then the derivative is an empty array, because the derivative of a constant is zero. So the function should return [].\n\nAnother test case: [0, 0, 0, 5]. The derivative is [0, 0, 15], because:\n\n- i=1: 0 * 1 = 0 \u2192 x^0 \u2192 0.\n- i=2: 0 * 2 = 0 \u2192 x^1 \u2192 0.\n- i=3: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 x^2 \u2192 15.\n\nSo the derivative is [0,0,15].\n\nWait, but what about the case where the input is [0]? Then the derivative is an empty array.\n\nSo, the function should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nThe function is called derivative and takes an array xs.\n\nWe can create a new array, let's call it result.\n\nLoop through each index i of xs:\n\n- if i is 0, skip (since the derivative of a constant is zero).\n- else, compute result[i-1] = xs[i] * i.\n\nWait, but wait: the result array's length is the length of xs minus 1, because the highest degree term is xs[n-1] * x^(n-1), whose derivative is (n-1)*xs[n-1] * x^(n-2), which is the highest degree term in the derivative.\n\nSo, the result array's length is xs.length - 1.\n\nSo,"], ["//The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:\n// fibfib(0) == 0\n// fibfib(1) == 0\n// fibfib(2) == 1\n// fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).\n// Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.\n// >>> fibfib(1)\n// 0\n// >>> fibfib(5)\n// 4\n// >>> fibfib(8)\n// 24\nfunction fibfib(n){ ... }\n</think><think>\nOkay, I need to write a function to compute the n-th element of the fibfib sequence.

Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe need to circularly shift the digits of the integer x, shifting the digits right by shift amount. Then return the result as a string. If shift is greater than the number of digits, we return the digits reversed. So, for example, circular_shift(12, 1) returns \"21\", and circular_shift(12, 2) returns \"12\".\n\nHmm, okay.

Let's think about the right circular shift. For example, if the string is \"1234\" and shift is 1, the right shift would make it \"4123\". Because each digit moves right by one, so the last digit comes to the front.\n\nWait, no. Wait, right circular shift by 1: the last digit moves to the front. So, for \"1234\", a right shift by 1 would be \"4123\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's think: shifting right by 1 means that each digit is moved to the right by one position, and the last digit wraps around to the front.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for example, \"1234\" shifted right by 1 becomes \"4123\".\n\nSimilarly, shifting right by 2 would take the last two digits and put them in front. So, \"1234\" shifted right by 2 becomes \"3412\".\n\nWait, no. Wait, shifting right by 2: each digit moves two positions to the right. So, the last two digits (3 and 4) move to the front, resulting in \"3412\".\n\nWait, but wait: for a right shift, the digits are moved to the right, so the last digit comes to the front. So, for a right shift of 1, the last digit is moved to the front.\n\nSo, for a string s, a right shift by 1 would be s[-1] + s[:-1].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, s = \"abcd\", shift = 1: s[-1] is 'd', s[:-1] is 'abc', so result is 'dabc'.\n\nSimilarly, for shift = 2: s[-2:] is 'cd', s[:-2] is 'ab', so result is 'cdab'.\n\nSo, in general, for a right shift of 'shift' steps, the resulting string is s[-shift:] + s[:-shift].\n\nBut wait, what if shift is larger than the length of the string? For example, s = \"abcd\", shift = 3. Then s[-3:] is 'bcd', s[:-3] is 'a', so result is 'bcd' + 'a' = 'bcda'.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, if shift is greater than the number of digits, we return the digits reversed.\n\nSo, for example, if s is \"abcd\" (n=4), and shift is 5, which is greater than 4, then we return s reversed, which is 'dcba'.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, if shift > n, return reversed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Convert x to a string s.\n\n- n = len(s).\n\n- if shift > n: return s reversed.\n\n- else: perform right circular shift by shift steps, which is s[-shift:] + s[:-shift].\n\nWait, but wait: for example, when shift is 0, we return the original string.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: circular_shift(12, 1).\n\ns = \"12\", n="], ["//Task\n// Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only'\n// ASCII codes.\n// Examples:\n// >>> digitSum(\"\")\n// 0\n// >>> digitSum(\"abAB\")\n// 131\n// >>> digitSum(\"abcCd\")\n// 67\n// >>> digitSum(\"helloE\")\n// 69\n// >>> digitSum(\"woArBld\")\n// 131\n// >>> digitSum(\"aAaaaXa\")\n// 153\nfunction digitSum(s){ ...}\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called digitSum that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only. The examples show that it's the sum of their ASCII codes. So, for example, in the first example, the input is an empty string, so the sum is 0. In the second example, \"abAB\" is given, and the sum is 131. Let's see why: 'a' is 97, 'b' is 98, 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66. Adding those together: 97 + 98 is 195, plus 65 is 260, plus 66 is 326. Wait, but the example says the sum is 131. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh, wait, maybe the function is supposed to sum the ASCII values of the uppercase letters only. Or perhaps it's the sum of the uppercase letters in the string. Let me check the examples again.\n\nWait, the first example is \"abAB\". The sum is 131. Let's calculate the ASCII codes of each character:\n\na is 97, b is 98, A is 65, B is 66. So 97 + 98 + 65 + 66 = 326. But the example says 131. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to sum the ASCII values of the uppercase letters only. Let's see: in \"abAB\", the uppercase letters are A and B. So 65 + 66 = 131. That matches the example. So perhaps the function is supposed to sum the ASCII codes of the uppercase letters only.\n\nWait, but the third example is \"abcCd\". The sum is 67. Let's see: 'a' is 97, 'b' is 98, 'c' is 99, 'C' is 67. So 97 + 98 + 99 + 67 = 361. But the example says 67. That's not matching. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is supposed to sum the ASCII codes of the uppercase letters only, regardless of their case. Let me check the examples again.\n\nWait, the second example: \"abAB\" has uppercase letters A and B. So 65 + 66 = 131. That's the example's output. So that's correct.\n\nThe third example: \"abcCd\" has uppercase letters C and d? Wait, no, 'C' is uppercase, 'd' is lowercase. So only 'C' is uppercase. So 67. That's the example's output. So that's correct.\n\nThe fourth example: \"helloE\" has uppercase 'E' only. 'h' is 104, 'e' is 101, 'l' is 108, 'l' is 108, 'o' is 111. So 104 + 101 + 108 + 108 + 111 = let's calculate: 104+101=205, +108=313, +108=421, +111=532. But the example says 69. That's not matching. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me re-calculate: \"helloE\" is h e l l o E. So their ASCII codes are:\n\nh: 104\n\ne: 101\n\nl: 108\n\nl: 108\n\no: 111\n\nE: 69\n\nSo sum is 104 + 101 = 205, +108 = 313, +108 = 421, +111 ="], ["//In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges \n// that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains \n// apples, oranges, and mango fruits.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe have a string that represents a basket of fruits. The string contains the number of apples and oranges, like \"5 apples and 6 oranges\". The integer n is the total number of fruits in the basket. We need to find out how many mangoes are in the basket.\n\nSo, the task is to parse the string, extract the number of apples and oranges, sum them, subtract from n to get the number of mangoes.\n\nLet's think about the steps:\n\n1. Parse the string to extract the count of apples and oranges.\n2. Calculate the total number of apples and oranges.\n3. Subtract this sum from n to get the number of mangoes.\n\nThe main challenge is parsing the string correctly. The string is in the format \"X apples and Y oranges\", where X and Y are numbers. But sometimes, the string might have more spaces or different wording, like \"5 apples and 6 oranges\" or \"10 apples and 3 oranges\".\n\nSo, the plan is to split the string into parts. Let's see:\n\n- The string is in the format \"X apples and Y oranges\", where X and Y are integers.\n- So, we can split the string into two parts: the first part is the number of apples, the second part is the number of oranges.\n\nBut how to extract X and Y from the string?\n\nOne approach is to split the string into tokens, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, we can use regular expressions to find the numbers and the words.\n\nYes, regular expressions would be the way to go here.\n\nLet's think about the regular expression pattern.\n\nThe string will have two parts: the number of apples and the number of oranges, each followed by \"apples\" and \"oranges\" respectively.\n\nSo, the pattern is something like:\n\n(\\d+) apples and (\\d+) oranges\n\nBut wait, the string could have other words, like \"and\", but in the examples, it's \"and\". So, perhaps the pattern is:\n\n(\\d+) apples and (\\d+) oranges\n\nBut in the string, it's \"and\", so the regex can capture that.\n\nSo, the regex pattern can be:\n\n/\\b(\\d+) apples and (\\d+) oranges\\b/\n\nBut wait, the string could have other words, like \"and\" or \"more\", but in the examples, it's \"and\". So, perhaps the pattern is:\n\n/\\b(\\d+) apples and (\\d+) oranges\\b/\n\nBut in the problem statement, the examples have \"and\", so perhaps the pattern is correct.\n\nWait, but in the string, the numbers are followed by \"apples\" and \"oranges\", but sometimes, the string could have other words, like \"more\", but in the problem statement, the examples only have \"and\". So, perhaps the pattern is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string could have \"more\" or other words, but the problem statement says that the string represents the number of apples and oranges, so perhaps the pattern is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use a regular expression to extract the number of apples and oranges.\n\nOnce we have the numbers, sum them, subtract from n to get the number of mangoes.\n\nSo, let's think about the code.\n\nThe function is called fruit_distribution(s, n), and it returns the number of mangoes.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nWe can use a regex to find the numbers.\n\nSomething like:\n\nconst match = s.match(/\\b(\\d+) apples and (\\d+) oranges\\b/);\n\nIf the match is found, then:\n\nconst apples = parseInt(match[1], 10);\nconst oranges = parseInt(match[2], 10);\n\nThen, total = apples + oranges.\n\nmangoes = n - total.\n\nReturn mangoes.\n\nBut wait, what if the string doesn't have the correct format? For example, if the string is \"5 apples and 6 oranges\", it's fine. But if it's \"5 apples and 6 oranges and 7 apples\", then"], ["//\"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes\n// your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.\n// The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.\n// If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.\n// The plucked node should be returned in an array, [ smalest_value, its index ],\n// If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\n// Example 1:\n// >>> pluck([4, 2, 3])\n// [2, 1]\n// Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n// Example 2:\n// >>> pluck([1, 2, 3])\n// [2, 1]\n// Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n// Example 3:\n// >>> pluck([])\n// []\n// Example 4:\n// >>> pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])\n// [0, 1]\n// Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,\n// so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.\n// Constraints:\n// * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\n// * 0 <= node.value\nfunction pluck(arr){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe have an array representing a branch of a tree, with non-negative integer nodes. Our task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it. The plucked node should be the one with the smallest even value. If there are multiple nodes with the same smallest even value, we return the one with the smallest index. If there are no even values or the array is empty, we return an empty array.\n\nExamples:\n\nExample 1: pluck([4, 2, 3]) returns [2, 1]. Because 2 is the smallest even value, and it's at index 1.\n\nExample 2: pluck([1, 2, 3]) returns [2, 1]. 2 is the smallest even, at index 1.\n\nExample 3: pluck([]) returns [].\n\nExample 4: pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]) returns [0, 1]. Because 0 is the smallest even, and it's at index 1. There's another 0 at index 4, but since 1 is smaller, we choose the first one.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the array.\n2. For each element, check if it's even.\n3. If it's even, keep track of the smallest even value found so far, along with its index.\n4. If multiple even numbers have the same smallest value, choose the one with the smallest index.\n5. If no even numbers are found, return an empty array.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, I'll need to loop through each element of the array. For each element, I'll check if it's even. How do I check if a number is even? Using modulo 2: if (num % 2 === 0).\n\nI'll need variables to keep track of the smallest even value and its index. Let's initialize them as null or undefined. Then, for each element, if it's even, compare it to the current smallest even value. If it's smaller, update the smallest even value and its index. If it's equal, since we want the smallest index, we don't change anything because the current index is smaller than the new one.\n\nWait, no. Because if the current even is 2, and the new even is also 2, but the new index is 1, which is smaller than the current index, we should update the smallest even value and its index. So, in that case, the new even is equal to the current, but the index is smaller, so we should update.\n\nSo, the logic is:\n\nInitialize smallestEven as null and smallestIndex as -1.\n\nFor each index, i, in the array:\n\n   if arr[i] is even:\n\n      if smallestEven is null or arr[i] < smallestEven:\n\n          smallestEven = arr[i]\n\n          smallestIndex = i\n\n      else if arr[i] == smallestEven:\n\n          if i < smallestIndex:\n\n              smallestIndex = i\n\nWait, but in the case where arr[i] is equal to the current smallestEven, but has a smaller index, we should update the smallestIndex. So, in the code, for each element, if it's even, we compare it to the current smallestEven. If it's smaller, we"], ["//You are given a non-empty array of positive integers.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given a non-empty array of positive integers. We need to return the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency (number of occurrences) greater than or equal to the integer itself. If no such integer exists, return -1.\n\nExamples:\n\nFirst example: [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. The output is 2. Let's see why. The frequency of 2 is 2, which is equal to the integer's value. So 2 is a candidate. Are there any higher numbers that satisfy this condition? The next higher number is 4, but its frequency is 1, which is less than 4. So 2 is the maximum.\n\nSecond example: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]. The output is 3. The frequency of 3 is 3, which is equal to 3. So 3 is a candidate. Are there any higher numbers? 4 has a frequency of 3, which is less than 4. So 3 is the maximum.\n\nThird example: [5,5,4,4,4]. The output is -1. Let's see. The frequencies are 2 for 5 and 3 for 4. For 5: 2 <5, so no. For 4: 3 <4, so no. So no such number exists.\n\nSo, the task is to find the maximum integer in the array that satisfies the condition: frequency >= value. If none, return -1.\n\nHow to approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to count the frequency of each integer in the array. So, I can create a frequency dictionary or a hash map where the key is the integer and the value is its count.\n\nOnce I have the frequencies, I can iterate through the array and for each integer, check if its frequency is >= the integer itself. Among all such integers, I need to find the maximum one.\n\nWait, but the array may have duplicates. So, for example, in the first example, 1 appears twice, 2 appears twice, 3 appears once. So, for each integer, I need to check if its frequency is >= the integer.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each integer in the array.\n\n2. For each integer in the array, check if its frequency is >= the integer.\n\n3. Collect all such integers that satisfy this condition.\n\n4. If there are any such integers, return the maximum one. Otherwise, return -1.\n\nWait, but step 2 and 3 can be optimized. Because, for each integer, we can check if its frequency is >= the integer. So, for each integer in the array, if the frequency is >= the integer, then it's a candidate.\n\nBut wait, the array may have multiple instances of the same integer. So, for example, in the first example, 2 appears twice, and 2 is a candidate. But 1 appears twice, but 1's frequency is 2, which is >=1. So, 1 is also a candidate. So, in that case, the maximum would be 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Create a frequency dictionary.\n\n- For each integer in the array, check if frequency of integer >= integer.\n\n- Collect all such integers.\n\n- If the collected list is not empty, return the maximum. Else, return -1.\n\nBut wait, the array may have multiple instances of the same integer. So, for example, in the first example, 2 appears twice, but 1 appears twice as well. So, both 1 and 2 are candidates.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count frequencies.\n\n2. For each integer in the array, check if frequency >= integer.\n\n3. Collect all such integers.\n\n4.

The strange order is built by starting with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining integers, then the minimum of the remaining integers, and so on, alternating between minimum and maximum, until all elements are used.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input is [1,2,3,4], which becomes [1,4,2,3].

So, the first element is min, then max, then min, then max.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Take min from the remaining elements, add to the new list.\n\n- Then take max from the remaining elements, add to the new list.\n\n- Then take min from the remaining elements, add to the new list.\n\n- Then take max from the remaining elements, add to the new list.\n\n- And so on until all elements are added.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize a new list.\n\nWhile the original list is not empty:\n\n   Take the current min from the remaining elements, add to new list.\n\n   If the original list is not empty:\n\n      Take the current max from the remaining elements, add to new list.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps:\n\ndef strange_sort_list(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return []\n    new_list = []\n    remaining = lst.copy()\n    while remaining:\n        # Take min\n        new_list.append(min(remaining))\n        remaining.remove(min(remaining))\n        # Take max if remaining is not empty\n        if remaining:\n            new_list.append(max(remaining))\n            remaining.remove(max(remaining))\n    return new_list\n\nWait, but in the first sample, [1,2,3,4], the code would do:\n\nremaining = [1,2,3,4]\n\nmin is 1, add to new_list. remaining becomes [2,3,4].\n\nmax is 4, add to new_list. remaining becomes [2,3].\n\nmin is 2, add to new_list. remaining becomes [3].\n\nmax is 3, add to new_list.\n\nSo, new_list is [1,4,2,3], which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5]. The code would take min 5, add to new_list. remaining is [5,5,5]. Then take max 5, add. remaining is [5,5]. Then min 5, add. remaining is [5]. Then max 5, add. So new_list is [5,5,5,5], which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3,1,2].

Otherwise, it should return -1. \n\nFirst, I remember that a valid triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. That means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, I need to check all three conditions: a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. If any of these are not true, the triangle is invalid, and I should return -1.\n\nIf the triangle is valid, then I can proceed to calculate the area. I recall that Heron's formula is useful for this. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle whose sides have lengths a, b, and c is sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)), where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if the given sides can form a valid triangle.\n   - Calculate the sum of each pair of sides and compare it to the third side.\n   - If any sum is less than or equal to the third side, return -1.\n\n2. If the triangle is valid, calculate the semi-perimeter (s).\n   - s = (a + b + c) / 2\n\n3. Use Heron's formula to compute the area.\n   - Area = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))\n\n4. Round the area to two decimal points and return it.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases. For example, if the sides are all equal, like 2, 2, 2, it should form a valid equilateral triangle. Heron's formula should handle that correctly. Another case is when the sides are very close to forming a triangle but just barely not, like 1, 2, 3. In this case, 1 + 2 is equal to 3, so it's invalid, and the function should return -1.\n\nWait, but in the example given, triangle_area(3,4,5) returns 6.0. Let me verify that. The semi-perimeter s is (3+4+5)/2 = 6. Then the area is sqrt(6*(6-3)*(6-4)*(6-5)) = sqrt(6*3*2*1) = sqrt(36) = 6. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: triangle_area(1,2,10). Let's check the triangle inequality. 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than 10. So, it's invalid, and the function returns -1.\n\nSo, the function should first check if the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third. If yes, return -1. Otherwise, proceed to calculate the area.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nThe function will take a, b, c as parameters.\n\nFirst, check the validity:\n\nif (a + b <= c) || (a + c <= b) || (b + c <= a):\n    return -1\n\nWait, but in code, it's better to write it as:\n\nif (a + b <= c) || (a + c <= b) || (b + c <= a):\n    return -1\n\nBut wait, in code, the condition should be if any of the three sums is less than or equal to the third side. So, if a + b <= c, or a + c <= b, or b + c <= a, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, but in code, the condition is written as (a + b <= c) || (a + c <= b) || (b + c <= a). So, if any of these is true, return -1.\n\nBut wait, in code, the condition is written as (a + b <= c) || (a + c <= b) || (b + c <= a). So, if any of these is true, the triangle is invalid.\n\nWait, but in code, the condition is written as:\n\nif (a + b <= c) || (a + c"], ["//Write a function that returns true if the object q will fly, and false otherwise.\n// The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic array) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.\n// Example:\n// >>> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)\n// false\n// # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.\n// >>> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)\n// false\n// # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.\n// >>> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)\n// true\n// # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n// >>> will_it_fly([3], 5)\n// true\n// # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\nfunction will_it_fly(q, w){ ...}\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a function called will_it_fly that takes two arguments: q and w. The function should return true if the object q will fly, and false otherwise. \n\nThe object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic array) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. \n\nSo, the function needs to check two conditions:\n\n1. Is q a palindromic array? \n2. Is the sum of the elements in q less than or equal to w?\n\nIf both conditions are true, return true; else, return false.\n\nLet's look at the examples provided to understand better.\n\nExample 1:\nwill_it_fly([1, 2], 5) returns false.\nExplanation: The array is not balanced because it's not a palindrome. The sum is 3, which is less than 5, but since it's unbalanced, it returns false.\n\nExample 2:\nwill_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) returns false.\nExplanation: The array is balanced (it's a palindrome), but the sum is 8, which is greater than 1. So, it returns false.\n\nExample 3:\nwill_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) returns true.\nExplanation: The array is balanced, and the sum is 8, which is less than 9. So, it returns true.\n\nExample 4:\nwill_it_fly([3], 5) returns true.\nExplanation: The array is a single-element array, which is a palindrome. The sum is 3, which is less than 5. So, it returns true.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n- Check if q is a palindrome array.\n- Check if the sum of the elements in q is <= w.\n- Return true only if both conditions are met.\n\nNow, how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, the function will receive q and w.\n\nWe need to check if q is a palindrome. How to do that?\n\nAn array is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for each index i, q[i] should be equal to q[length - 1 - i].\n\nSo, for example, for [3,2,3], length is 3. So, for i=0, q[0] = 3, q[2] =3. For i=1, q[1]=2, q[1]=2. So, it's a palindrome.\n\nSo, the function to check if q is a palindrome can be written as:\n"], ["//Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that\n// need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that\n// is read the same backwards and forwards.

Let's see. The task is to find the minimum number of elements to change in an array so that it becomes a palindrome. Each change allows us to replace one element with any other element. So, for each pair of elements in the array that are supposed to be equal in a palindrome, if they are not equal, we need to change at least one of them. But since we can change one element, we can choose to change either the left or the right element, whichever requires fewer changes.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's about the minimum number of changes. So, for each pair, if the two elements are different, we have to change at least one of them. But since we can change one element, we can choose to change either one, but we have to count the minimum number of changes required across all such pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because for each pair, if the two elements are different, we have to change at least one of them. So, for each such pair, we have to make a change. So, the total number of changes is equal to the number of mismatched pairs.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the first example, the array is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]. Let's see:\n\nIndices 0 and 7: 1 vs 6 \u2192 mismatch.\nIndices 1 and 6: 2 vs 9 \u2192 mismatch.\nIndices 2 and 5: 3 vs 7 \u2192 mismatch.\nIndices 3 and 4: 5 vs 4 \u2192 mismatch.\nSo, four mismatched pairs. So the answer is 4, which matches the first example.\n\nIn the second example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]. Let's see:\n\nIndices 0 and 6: 1 vs 2 \u2192 mismatch.\nIndices 1 and 5: 2 vs 2 \u2192 match.\nIndices 2 and 4: 3 vs 3 \u2192 match.\nIndices 3 and 3: 4 vs 2 \u2192 mismatch.\nSo, two mismatched pairs. So the answer is 1, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the second example, the answer is 1. So, how? Because for the first pair, we have to change one of them. For the third pair, we have to change one of them. So, total changes are 2. But the answer is 1. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the second example, the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]. So, the pairs are:\n\n0 and 6: 1 vs 2 \u2192 mismatch.\n1 and 5: 2 vs 2 \u2192 match.\n2 and 4: 3 vs 3 \u2192 match.\n3 and 3: 4 vs 2 \u2192 mismatch.\n\nSo, two mismatched pairs. So, the minimum number of changes is 2. But the sample says the answer is 1. Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh, wait, the problem says that in one change, you can change one element to any other element. So, for each pair that is mismatched, you have to change at least one element. So, the total number of changes is the number of mismatched pairs.\n\nBut in the second example, the answer is 1. So, that suggests that the number of changes is 1. But according to my earlier reasoning, it's 2. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the array is of even length, and the middle elements don't matter. So, perhaps the number of mismatched pairs is the number of changes needed. But in the second example, the array is of length 7, which is odd. So, the middle element can be anything, and it doesn't affect the palindrome.

But wait, the examples include 0, which is an integer, and 180, which is an integer but not a cube. So I need to handle all integers, positive, negative, and zero.\n\nFirst, let's think about the cube of an integer. For example, 1 is 1^3, 8 is 2^3, -1 is (-1)^3, 64 is 4^3, 0 is 0^3. So the function needs to check if a is equal to some integer n cubed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the cube root of a. Since a is an integer, but cube roots can be floating points, we need to find an integer n such that n^3 = a.\n\n2. Check if n is an integer. If n is an integer, then a is a cube.\n\nBut how do I compute the cube root accurately in JavaScript? Because for some numbers, the cube root might not be an integer, but due to floating point precision, it might be very close. So, perhaps we can compute the cube root, round it to the nearest integer, and then check if that integer cubed equals a.\n\nWait, but for negative numbers, the cube root is negative. So, for example, cube root of -8 is -2.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute the cube root of a. Let's call it n.\n\n- Round n to the nearest integer. But wait, for numbers that are not perfect cubes, the cube root will not be an integer. So, for example, cube root of 2 is approximately 1.26, which when rounded is 1. But 1^3 is 1, which is not equal to 2. So, in that case, the function should return false.\n\nBut how to compute the cube root accurately?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the integer n such that n^3 is equal to a. So, for a given a, we can compute n as the cube root, and then check if n^3 equals a.\n\nBut how to compute n? Since a can be negative, perhaps we can take the absolute value, compute the cube root, and then check if the sign is correct.\n\nWait, but for a negative a, the cube root is negative.

So, each character in the string is either a digit or a letter, and I need to check if it's a prime digit.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how to represent each character as its corresponding value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, 'C' is 12, and so on up to 'F' which is 15. So, I can create a mapping object that converts each character to its corresponding value.\n\nWait, but the input is a hexadecimal string, so each character is either a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-F). So, for each character in the input string, I need to determine if it's a prime digit. If it is, I count it.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Create a mapping of each character to its value. For example, 'A' maps to 10, 'B' to 11, etc.\n\n2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n\n3. For each character, check if it's a prime digit. That is, check if the character is a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-F), and then see if its corresponding value is a prime number.\n\n4. Count how many such characters there are.\n\nSo, first, let's create the mapping. Let's see, the letters A-F correspond to 10-15. So, for each character in the string, if it's a letter, we can check if it's between A-F, and then get its value. If it's a digit, we can get its numeric value.\n\nWait, but the input is a hexadecimal string, so the letters are uppercase. So, for each character in the string:\n\n- If it's a letter (A-F), we can map it to its value (10-15).\n\n- If it's a digit (0-9), we can map it to its numeric value (0-9).\n\nSo, the first step is to create a function that converts a character to its value. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nWe can create an object where each key is a character (like 'A', 'B', etc.) and the value is its corresponding numeric value.

But let's see: if decimal is 0, the binary is '0', so the output is 'db0db'.\n\nBut let's think about how to convert a decimal number to binary in Python.\n\nIn Python, the bin() function returns a string that starts with '0b'. So, for example, bin(15) returns '0b1111'. So, to get the binary digits without the '0b' prefix, we can slice it.\n\nSo, for a given decimal number, we can do:\n\nbinary_str = bin(decimal)[2:]\n\nBut wait, what if the decimal is 0? bin(0) returns '0b0', so [2:] is '0', which is correct.\n\nSo, the binary_str is bin(decimal)[2:].\n\nThen, we need to prepend 'db' and append 'db' to this string.\n\nSo, the final string is 'db' + binary_str + 'db'.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the binary_str is in the middle, and the 'db's are at the beginning and end.\n\nSo, for 15, binary_str is '1111', so the result is 'db' + '1111' + 'db' = 'db1111db'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    binary_str = bin(decimal)[2:]\n    return 'db' + binary_str + 'db'\n\nWait, but let's test this with the examples.\n\nTest case 1: decimal_to_binary(15) should return \"db1111db\".\n\nUsing the function:\n\nbinary_str = bin(15)[2:] \u2192 '1111'\n\nreturn 'db' + '1111' + 'db' \u2192 'db1111db' \u2192 correct.\n\nTest case 2: decimal_to_binary(32) \u2192 'db100000db'.\n\nbinary_str is bin(32)[2:] \u2192 '100000'\n\nreturn 'db' + '100000' + 'db' \u2192 'db100000db' \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case: decimal_to_binary(0) \u2192 'db0db'.\n\nbinary_str is '0' \u2192 '"], ["//You are given a string s.\n// Your task is to check if the string is hapjs or not.\n// A string is hapjs if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\n// For example:\n// >>> is_happy(\"a\")\n// false\n// >>> is_happy(\"aa\")\n// false\n// >>> is_happy(\"abcd\")\n// true\n// >>> is_happy(\"aabb\")\n// false\n// >>> is_happy(\"adb\")\n// true\n// >>> is_happy(\"xyy\")\n// false\nfunction is_happy(s){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called is_happy that takes a string s and returns True if it's a hapj, else False.\n\nSo, the problem is to check two conditions:\n\n1. The length of the string is at least 3. If it's less than 3, return False.\n\n2. Every 3 consecutive letters are distinct. So, for every substring of length 3, all characters must be unique.\n\nSo, for example, \"aabb\" is false because the first three letters are \"aab\", which has duplicates. Similarly, \"xyy\" is false because the first three letters are \"x\", \"y\", \"y\", which has duplicates.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n- Check if the length is at least 3. If not, return False.\n\n- Then, for each triplet of consecutive letters, check if all three are unique.\n\n- If any triplet has duplicates, return False.\n\n- If all triplets are unique, return True.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, the function is_happy(s) takes a string s.\n\nFirst, check if len(s) < 3. If yes, return False.\n\nElse, loop through the string, taking each triplet of consecutive characters.\n\nFor each triplet, check if all characters are unique.\n\nIf any triplet has duplicates, return False.\n\nIf all triplets are unique, return True.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, for a string s, the triplets can be taken as s[i:i+3] for i in range(len(s)-2).\n\nWait, no. Because for a string of length n, the number of triplets is n-2. So, for i from 0 to n-3, inclusive.\n\nWait, for example, for s = \"abcd\", which is length 4, the triplets are \"abc\", \"bcd\". So, i runs from 0 to 1 (since 4-3=1). So, the loop can be for i in range(len(s)-2).\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to len(s)-3, inclusive.\n\nWait, len(s)-3 is the last index of the triplet. So, the loop can be for i in range(len(s)-2), because for i in 0 to len(s)-3, inclusive, the triplet is s[i:i+3].\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf len(s) is 4, then len(s)-3 is 1. So, the loop should run for i from 0 to 1 (inclusive). So, range(len(s)-2) is 2, so 0 and 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each i in range(len(s)-2):\n\n   triplet = s[i:i+3]\n\n   if len(triplet) !=3:  # which it can't be, since i is up to len(s)-3.\n\n   check if all characters in triplet are unique.\n\n   if any triplet has duplicates, return False.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef is_happy(s):\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    for i in range(len(s)-2):\n        triplet = s[i:i+3]\n        if len(triplet) !=3:\n            # shouldn't happen, but just in case\n            continue\n        if len(set(triplet)) !=3:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where the triplet is longer than 3, but that's not possible because we're taking i up to len(s)-3.\n\nWait, no. Because len(s)-2 is the upper limit for i, so the maximum i is len(s)-3, so the triplet is s[i:i+3], which is 3 characters.\n\nSo, the code is safe.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nExample 1: is_happy(\"a\") \u2192 False. Correct.\n\nExample 2: is_happy(\"aa\") \u2192 False. Correct.\n\nExample 3: is_happy(\"abcd\") \u2192 True. Correct.\n\nExample 4: is_happy(\"aabb\") \u2192 False. Because the first triplet is \"aab\", which has duplicates.\n\nExample 5: is_happy(\"adb\") \u2192 True. Because the triplet is \"adb\", all unique.\n\nAnother test case"], ["//It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades\n// to students.

The function takes an array of numbers, each representing a student's GPA. For each GPA, I need to determine the corresponding letter grade from the table. The output is an array of these letter grades in the same order as the input.\n\nLet me look at the example given:\n\ngrade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) returns [\"A+\", \"B\", \"C-\", \"C\", \"A-\"]\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n- 4.0: According to the table, this is an A+.\n- 3.0: This is a B.\n- 1.7: This is a C.\n- 2.0: This is a C-.\n- 3.5: This is an A-.\n\nSo, each GPA is mapped to a letter grade based on the ranges specified.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each GPA in the input array, determine the corresponding letter grade.\n2. Create a list of these letter grades in the same order as the input.\n\nNow, how to map the GPA to the letter grade? Let's see the table:\n\nGPA | Letter\n4.0 | A+\n3.7 | A\n3.3 | A-\n3.0 | B+\n2.7 | B\n2.3 | B-\n2.0 | C+\n1.7 | C\n1.3 | C-\n1.0 | D+\n0.7 | D\n0.0 | D-\n0.0 | E\n\nWait, but the table is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine it:\n\nThe table shows that:\n\n- 4.0 is A+\n- 3.7 is A\n- 3.3 is A-\n- 3.0 is B+\n- 2.7 is B\n- 2.3 is B-\n- 2.0 is C+\n- 1.7 is C\n- 1.3 is C-\n- 1.0 is D+\n- 0.7 is D\n- 0.0 is D-\n0.0 is E\n\nWait, but 0.0 is E, and 0.7 is D. So, 0.0 is E, and 0.7 is D.\n\nSo, the mapping is as follows:\n\n- GPA >= 4.0: A+\n- 3.7 < GPA <4.0: A\n- 3.3 < GPA <=3.7: A-\n- 3.0 < GPA <=3.3: B+\n- 2.7 < GPA <=3.0: B\n- 2.3 < GPA <=2.7: B-\n- 2.0 < GPA <=2.3: C+\n- 1.7 < GPA <=2.0: C\n- 1.3 < GPA <=1.7: C-\n- 1.0 < GPA <=1.3: D+\n- 0.7 < GPA <=1.0: D\n- 0.0 < GPA <=0.7: D-\n0.0: E\n\nWait, but 0.0 is E, and 0.7 is D.\n\nSo, the steps to map a GPA to a letter grade are:\n\n- If GPA >=4.0: A+\n- Else if GPA >=3.7: A\n- Else if GPA >=3"], ["//Write a function that takes a string and returns true if the string\n// length is a prime number or false otherwise\n// Examples\n// >>> prime_length(\"Hello\")\n// true\n// >>> prime_length(\"abcdcba\")\n// true\n// >>> prime_length(\"kittens\")\n// true\n// >>> prime_length(\"orange\")\n// false\nfunction prime_length(string){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called prime_length that takes a string and returns true if its length is a prime number, and false otherwise. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the length of the string. That's straightforward using the length property of the string object. So, I can get the length by doing string.length.\n\nOnce I have the length, I need to check if it's a prime number. So, the core of the problem is to write a function that checks for primality.\n\nWait, what's a prime number? A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, for example, 2 is prime, 3 is prime, 4 is not (since it's divisible by 2), and so on.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Get the length of the string.\n2. Check if the length is less than 2. If it is, return false because primes are greater than 1.\n3. For numbers 2 and above, check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any divisor divides it evenly, it's not a prime.\n4. If none of the divisors work, it's a prime.\n\nLet me outline this in code.\n\nFirst, get the length:\n\nlet len = string.length;\n\nThen, if len is less than 2, return false.\n\nif (len < 2) return false;\n\nThen, check for divisibility. Let's loop from 2 to sqrt(len). For each i, check if len % i === 0. If yes, return false.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the square root? I can use Math.sqrt(len).\n\nSo, for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(len); i++) { ... }\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, the loop condition is i <= Math.sqrt(len). But since i is an integer, and Math.sqrt returns a float, this might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can loop up to Math.floor(Math.sqrt(len)) + 1, but perhaps it's better to loop up to i <= Math.sqrt(len) and then check if i is an integer.\n\nWait, no, because in the loop, i is an integer. So, perhaps it's better to loop up to i <= Math.sqrt(len), but since i is an integer, the condition would be i <= Math.sqrt(len). But since i is an integer, this might not capture all possible divisors correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to loop up to i <= Math.sqrt(len), but then check if i is an integer. Hmm, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to loop up to i <= Math.sqrt(len), but then check if len is divisible by i. If it is, then return false.\n\nWait, but for example, if len is 4, sqrt is 2. So, the loop would run for i=2. 4 % 2 is 0, so return false.\n\nBut what about len=9, sqrt is 3. So, i=2: 9%2 is 1, i=3: 9%3 is 0, so return false.\n\nWait, but what about len=15, sqrt is ~3.872. So, the loop would run for i=2,3. 15%2 is 1, 15%3 is 0, so return false.\n\nSo, the loop correctly identifies that 15 is not a prime.\n\nBut what about len=25, sqrt is 5. So, the loop runs for i=2,3,4,5. 25%2 is 1, 25%3 is 1, 25%4 is 1, 25%5 is 0, so returns false.\n\nSo, the loop correctly identifies that 25 is not a prime.\n\nWait, but what about len=49, which is 7 squared. The loop runs up to 7. 49%7 is 0, so returns false.\n\nSo, the loop correctly identifies that 49 is not a prime.\n\nBut what about len=1? The function returns false, which is correct because 1 is not a prime.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n"], ["//Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n// positive integers that start or end with 1.\nfunction starts_one_ends(n){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, so I need to find the number of n-digit positive integers that either start with 1 or end with 1. Hmm, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, what defines an n-digit positive integer? It's a number with exactly n digits, so it can't start with 0. The first digit must be from 1 to 9, and the rest can be from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, the total number of n-digit positive integers is 9 * 10^(n-1). That's because the first digit has 9 options, and each of the remaining n-1 digits has 10 options.\n\nNow, the problem is to find how many of these numbers either start with 1 or end with 1. So, we can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet me define two sets:\n\nA: The set of n-digit numbers that start with 1.\n\nB: The set of n-digit numbers that end with 1.\n\nWe need to find |A \u222a B|, which is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nSo, let's compute each of these.\n\nFirst, |A|: The number of n-digit numbers that start with 1. The first digit is fixed as 1, and the remaining n-1 digits can be anything from 0 to 9. So, |A| = 1 * 10^(n-1) = 10^(n-1).\n\nNext, |B|: The number of n-digit numbers that end with 1. The last digit is fixed as 1, and the first n-1 digits can be anything from 1 to 9 for the first digit and 0 to 9 for the others. So, |B| = 9 * 10^(n-2) * 1 = 9 * 10^(n-2).\n\nWait, let me think again. For the first n-1 digits, the first digit can be 1-9, so 9 options, and the remaining n-2 digits can be 0-9, so 10 options each. So, |B| = 9 * 10^(n-2).\n\nNow, |A \u2229 B|: The number of n-digit numbers that both start with 1 and end with 1. So, the first digit is 1, the last digit is 1, and the middle n-2 digits can be anything. So, |A \u2229 B| = 1 * 10^(n-2) * 1 = 10^(n-2).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 10^(n-1) + 9*10^(n-2) - 10^(n-2).\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nFirst, let's factor out 10^(n-2):\n\n10^(n-1) is equal to 10 * 10^(n-2), so:\n\n10^(n-1) + 9*10^(n-2) - 10^(n-2) = 10*10^(n-2) + 9*10^(n-2) - 1*10^(n-2).\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n(10 + 9 - 1) * 10^(n-2) = 18 * 10^(n-2).\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 10*10^(n-2) is 10^(n-1), and 9*10^(n-2) is 9*10^(n-2), and subtracting 10^(n-2) gives 8*10^(n-2). So, 10^(n-1) + 9*10^(n-2) - 10^(n-2) = 10^(n-1) + 8*10^(n-2).\n\nWait, 10^(n-1) is 10*10^(n-2), so 10*10^(n-2) + 8*10^(n-2) = 18*10^(n-2).\n\nSo, |A \u222a B| = 18 * 10^(n-2).\n\nWait, but let me test this with a small n to see if it makes sense.\n\nLet's take n=1. Then, the number of 1-digit"], ["//Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.\n// Example\n// >>> solve(1000)\n// \"1\"\n// >>> solve(150)\n// \"110\"\n// >>> solve(147)\n// \"1100\"\n// Variables:\n// @N integer\n// Constraints: 0 \u2264 N \u2264 10000.\n// Output:\n// a string of binary number\nfunction solve(N){ ... }\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total sum of the digits in the binary representation of a given positive integer \\( N \\). Let's break down the approach step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe goal is to convert the given integer \\( N \\) into its binary representation and then sum the digits of this binary number. For example, if \\( N = 1000 \\), its binary representation is \\( 1111101000 \\), and the sum of its digits is \\( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Convert \\( N \\) to Binary\nTo convert a decimal number to binary, we can use the method of dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainders. The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\nFor example:\n- \\( 1000 \\div 2 = 500 \\) with a remainder of \\( 0 \\)\n- \\( 500 \\div 2 = 250 \\) with a remainder of \\( 0 \\)\n- \\( 250 \\div 2 = 125 \\) with a remainder of \\( 0 \\)\n- \\( 125 \\div 2 = 62 \\) with a remainder of \\( 1 \\)\n- \\( 62 \\div 2 = 31 \\) with a remainder of \\( 0 \\)\n- \\( 31 \\div 2 = 15 \\) with a remainder of \\( 1 \\)\n- \\( 15 \\div 2 = 7 \\) with a remainder of \\( 1 \\)\n- \\( 7 \\div 2 = 3 \\) with a remainder of \\( 1 \\)\n- \\( 3 \\div 2 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 1 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\div 2 = 0 \\) with a remainder of \\( 1 \\)\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of \\( 1000 \\) is \\( 1111101000 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Sum the Digits of the Binary Representation\nOnce we have the binary representation of \\( N \\), we can sum its digits. For example, the binary representation of \\( 1000 \\) is \\( 1111101000 \\), and the sum of its digits is \\( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Implement the Solution\nTo implement this solution, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Convert \\( N \\) to Binary**: Write a function to convert the given integer \\( N \\) into its binary representation.\n2. **Sum the Digits**: Iterate through each digit of the binary number and sum them up.\n\n### Solution Code\n```javascript"], ["//Given a non-empty array of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n// Examples:\n// >>> add([4, 2, 6, 7])\n// 2\nfunction add(lst){ ... }"], ["//Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.\n// Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)\n// are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n// ascending order based on ascii value.\n// Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n// For example:\n// >>> anti_shuffle(\"Hi\")\n// \"Hi\"\n// >>> anti_shuffle(\"hello\")\n// \"ehllo\"\n// >>> anti_shuffle(\"Hello World!!!\")\n// \"Hello !!!Wdlor\"\nfunction anti_shuffle(s){}\n\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called anti_shuffle that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. The ordered version is where each word is rearranged into a new word with all characters sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values. Also, the order of the words and the positions of the spaces should remain the same as the original string.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I need to split the input string into words. But wait, what counts as a word here? Because in the example, \"Hello World!!!\", the output is \"Hello !!!Wdlor\". So the exclamation mark is considered part of the word? Or is it a separate word? Hmm, looking at the example, the output is \"Hello !!!Wdlor\". So the exclamation mark is part of the word, and the output is \"Hello\" followed by \"!!!Wdlor\". So I think that the function treats any sequence of characters separated by whitespace as a word, including those with punctuation.\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into an array of words, where each word is a sequence of non-whitespace characters. But wait, in the example, the input is \"Hello World!!!\", which is split into [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!!!\"]? Or is it [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!!!\"], but when rearranged, the exclamation marks are moved to the end.\n\nWait, the example shows that the output is \"Hello !!!Wdlor\". So the original words are \"Hello\" and \"World\", and the exclamation marks are part of the \"World\" word. So the function is treating each word as a sequence of characters, including those with punctuation, and when rearranged, the punctuation is moved to the end of the word.\n\nSo, the first step is to split the string into words, where each word is a sequence of non-whitespace characters. So, in the example, \"Hello World!!!\", the words are [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!!!\"]? Or wait, no, the input is \"Hello World!!!\", which is \"Hello\" followed by \"World\" followed by \"!!!\". So the words are [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!!!\"].\n\nThen, for each word, we need to sort the characters in the word in ascending order based on their ASCII values. So, for \"Hello\", the sorted version is \"eHllo\" (wait, no, \"H\" is 72, \"e\" is 101, \"l\" is 108, \"l\" is 108, \"o\" is 111. So sorted, it's \"eHllo\". But in the example, the output is \"ehllo\" for \"Hello\". Wait, the example shows that anti_shuffle(\"Hello\") returns \"ehllo\". So \"Hello\" is \"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\". So when sorted, it's \"e\", \"H\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\", which is \"ehllo\". So the function is treating each word as a sequence of characters, including those with punctuation, and sorting them, but the punctuation is kept as part of the word.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the input string into words, where each word is a sequence of non-whitespace characters. So, words can include punctuation, numbers, etc.\n\n2. For each word, sort the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values. So, for each word, create a new string where the characters are ordered from the lowest ASCII value to the highest.\n\n3. Reconstruct the string by joining the sorted words with spaces in between.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- Split the string into words. In JavaScript, the split method can be used with a regular expression that matches any whitespace. So, s.split(/\\s+/) would split the string into words, ignoring any whitespace.\n\nWait, but in the example, the input is \"Hello World!!!\", which is split into [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!!!\"]? Or is it [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!!!\"]? Because the split method with /\\s+/ will split on any whitespace, so \"Hello World!!!\" would be split into [\"Hello\", \""], ["//You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested arrays,\n// which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,\n// each row may contain a different number of columns.\n// Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the array,\n// and return array of arrays, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that\n// each array is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.\n// Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.\n// Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.\n// Examples:\n// >>> get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], 1)\n// [[0, 0], [1, 4], [1, 0], [2, 5], [2, 0]]\n// >>> get_row([], 1)\n// []\n// >>> get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)\n// [[2, 2]]\nfunction get_row(lst, x){ ...}\nOkay, I need to solve this problem.

Then, we have to return an array of these coordinates, sorted in a specific way.\n\nThe sorting rules are as follows:\n\n1. Sort the coordinates initially by their row in ascending order.\n2. Then, within each row, sort the columns in descending order.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order. Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.\" Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify what exactly is meant by \"coordinates of the row\". Maybe it's that for each row, the columns are sorted in descending order, and then the rows are sorted based on their first element (the row index).\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nIn the first example, the input is [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], and x is 1. The output is [[0,0], [1,4], [1,0], [2,5], [2,0]].\n\nLet's see:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: [1,2,3,4,5,6] \u2192 1 is at index 0 \u2192 (0,0)\nRow 1: [1,2,3,4,1,6] \u2192 1 is at index 0 and 4 \u2192 (1,0), (1,4)\nRow 2: [1,2,3,4,5,1] \u2192 1 is at index 0 and 5 \u2192 (2,0), (2,5)\n\nSo the output is all these coordinates.\n\nNow, the sorting rules:\n\n1. Sort by rows in ascending order. So, the rows are ordered based on their row index. So, row 0 comes first, then row 1, then row 2.\n\n2. Within each row, sort the columns in descending order. So, for each row, the columns are ordered from highest to lowest.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [[0,0], [1,4], [1,0], [2,5], [2,0]]. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: (0,0) \u2192 columns are [0,0] \u2192 sorted in descending order is same.\n\nRow 1: (1,4) and (1,0). So, columns are 4 and 0 \u2192 sorted in descending order is 4,0. So, the order is (1,4), (1,0).\n\nRow 2: (2,5) and (2,0). Columns are 5 and 0 \u2192 sorted in descending order is 5,0. So, the order is (2,5), (2,0).\n\nSo, the output is ordered by row index, and within each row, columns are sorted in descending order.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Iterate through each row in the input list, and for each element, check if it equals x. Collect all the coordinates (row index, column index) where the value is x.\n\n2. Once we have all the coordinates, we need to sort"], ["//Given an array of non-negative integers, return a cojs of the given array after sorting,\n// you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,\n// or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.\n// Note:\n// * don't change the given array.\n// Examples:\n// >>> sort_array([])\n// []\n// >>> sort_array([5])\n// [5]\n// >>> sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5])\n// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// >>> sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6])\n// [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]\nfunction sort_array(array){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to sort an array of non-negative integers. The sorting depends on the sum of the first and last index values. If the sum is odd, we sort in ascending order. If it's even, we sort in descending order. But we have to do this without changing the original array.\n\nWait, no, the note says not to change the given array. So, the array is given, and we have to sort it based on the sum of the first and last elements. Wait, no, the sum is of the first index value and the last index value. Wait, no, the problem says: \"the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd, or even.\"\n\nWait, no, the problem says: \"sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd, or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.\"\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me rephrase: For each pair of elements in the array, the first element is at index i, the last is at index j. We compute i + j. If it's odd, we sort the array in ascending order. If it's even, we sort it in descending order.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the array is a list of elements, not a list of indices. So, the first element is at index 0, the last is at index n-1. So, the sum is 0 + (n-1) = n-1. So, if n-1 is odd, we sort in ascending order. If it's even, we sort in descending order.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, the sum is of the first and last elements, not of their indices. Oh, that's a crucial point.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd, or even.\" So, the first index is 0, the last is n-1. So, the sum is 0 + (n-1) = n-1. So, if n-1 is odd, we sort in ascending order. If it's even, we sort in descending order.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, the sum is of the first and last elements, not of their indices. So, for example, in the first example, the array is empty, so nothing to do. In the second example, [5], the sum is 0 + 0 = 0, which is even, so we sort in descending order. But since it's a single element, it remains the same.\n\nIn the third example, [2,4,3,0,1,5], the length is 6. So, first index is 0, last is 5. Sum is 0+5=5, which is odd. So, we sort in ascending order.\n\nIn the fourth example, [2,4,3,0,1,5,6], length is 7. 0+6=6, which is even. So, we sort in descending order.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the third example is [2,4,3,0,1,5], which is length 6. So, 0+5=5, which is odd. So, we sort in ascending order, resulting in [0,1,2,3,4,5].\n\nWait, but in the fourth example, [2,4,3,0,1,5,6], the length is 7. 0+6=6, which is even. So, we sort in descending order, resulting in [6,5,4,3,2,1,0].\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Determine the length of the array, n.\n\n2"], ["//Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and\n// returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. \n// The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters \n// shift down by two multiplied to two places.\n// For example:\n// >>> encrypt(\"hi\")\n// \"lm\"\n// >>> encrypt(\"asdfghjkl\")\n// \"ewhjklnop\"\n// >>> encrypt(\"gf\")\n// \"kj\"\n// >>> encrypt(\"et\")\n// \"ix\"\nfunction encrypt(s){ ... }\n\nOkay, I need to figure out how to implement this function. Let's see, the problem says that the alphabet is rotated such that each letter shifts down by two multiplied by two places. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the example again.\n\nIn the first example, encrypt(\"hi\") returns \"lm\". So, the letters 'h' and 'i' are shifted down by two places. Wait, but two multiplied by two is four. So, each letter is shifted down by four places. Let me check: 'h' shifted down by four would be 'l' (since h is the 8th letter, 8-4=4, which is 'e'? Wait, no, maybe I'm counting wrong. Wait, the alphabet is a to z, so a is 0, b is 1, ..., z is 25. So, shifting down by four would mean subtracting four from the current position.\n\nWait, let's take the first example: 'h' is the 7th letter (a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3, e=4, f=5, g=6, h=7). Shifting down by four would be 7-4=3, which is 'd'. But the example shows that 'h' becomes 'l', which is 11. So that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that the letters shift down by two multiplied by two places. So, two multiplied by two is four. So, each letter is shifted down by four places. So, 'h' shifted down by four would be 'd', but the example shows 'h' becomes 'l'. So that's not matching. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a shift down, but a rotation. Let me think again. The problem says that the alphabet is rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied by two places. So, perhaps each letter is shifted down by two places, but multiplied by two. So, each letter is shifted down by four places. But in the first example, 'h' becomes 'l', which is a shift of four places down. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let's check the second example: encrypt(\"asdfghjkl\") returns \"ewhjklnop\". Let's take the first letter 'a' and see what it becomes. 'a' is 0, shifting down by four would be 0-4 = -4, which is equivalent to 22 (since 26-4=22). So 'a' becomes 'w' (since 22 is 'w'). But the example shows that 'a' becomes 'e'. Wait, that's not matching. So perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is not down, but up. Let me think again. The problem says that the letters shift down by two multiplied by two places. So, perhaps each letter is shifted down by four places. So, 'a' shifted down by four would be 'w', but the example shows that 'a' becomes 'e'. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is up by four places. So, 'a' shifted up by four would be 'e' (since a is 0, 0+4=4, which is 'e'). That matches the example. So, perhaps the shift is up by four places.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the letters shift down by two multiplied by two places. So, that would be down by four. But the example shows that 'a' becomes 'e', which is a shift up by four. So, perhaps the problem is that the shift is in the opposite direction. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is two multiplied by two, which is four, but the direction is up. So, each letter is shifted up by four places.\n\nWait, let's see the first example: 'h' shifted up by four would be 'l' (h is 7, 7+4=11, which is 'l'). That matches. The second example: 'a' shifted up by four is 'e' (0+4=4). The third example: 'g' shifted up by four is 'k' (6+"], ["//You are given an array of integers.\n// Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the array.\n// Return undefined if there is no such element.\n// >>> next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n// 2\n// >>> next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2])\n// 2\n// >>> next_smallest([])\n// undefined\n// >>> next_smallest([1, 1])\n// undefined\nfunction next_smallest(lst){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a function called next_smallest that takes an array of integers and returns the second smallest element. If there's no such element, it should return undefined. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the edge cases. If the array has less than two elements, like an empty array or an array with only one element, then there's no second smallest element. So in those cases, the function should return undefined. That's straightforward.\n\nBut for arrays with two or more elements, I need to find the second smallest. Wait, but what if all elements are the same? Like [5,5]. Then, there's no second smallest element because all elements are equal. So in that case, the function should return undefined as well.\n\nSo the plan is: \n\n1. Check if the array has at least two elements. If not, return undefined.\n2. If the array has two or more elements, sort them to find the second smallest.\n3. However, I need to be careful because sorting might not be the most efficient way, but for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but what if the array has duplicates? Like [2,2,3]. Then the second smallest is 2. So when I sort the array, the second element in the sorted array would be 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- If the array length is less than 2, return undefined.\n- Sort the array in ascending order.\n- Check if the second element is the same as the first. If yes, then there are duplicates, so the second smallest is the first element. But wait, in the case of [1,1], the second element is 1, which is the same as the first. So the function should return undefined because there's no second distinct smallest element.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the case of [1,1], the second smallest is 1, but since all elements are the same, there's no second distinct element. So the function should return undefined.\n\nSo, after sorting, if the first element is equal to the second, then there are duplicates, and the second smallest doesn't exist. So in that case, return undefined.\n\nWait, but what about [2,2,3]. The sorted array is [2,2,3]. The second element is 2, which is the same as the first. So the second smallest is 2, but since there are duplicates, the function should return undefined.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in [2,2,3], the second smallest is 2, but since the array has more than two elements, the second smallest is 2. So in this case, the function should return 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second smallest is the second element in the sorted array. So in [2,2,3], the sorted array is [2,2,3]. The second element is 2, which is the same as the first. So the function should return 2.\n\nWait, but the problem says to return the second smallest element. So in this case, the second smallest is 2, which is the same as the first. So the function should return 2.\n\nWait, but in the case of [1,1], the second element is 1, which is the same as the first. So the function should return undefined.\n\nSo, the logic is: after sorting, if the first element is equal to the second, then there are duplicates, so the second smallest doesn't exist. So return undefined.\n\nWait, but in the case of [2,2,3], the second element is 2, which is the same as the first. So the function should return 2.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the function is supposed to return the second smallest element. So in [2,2,3], the second smallest is 2, but since the array has more than two elements, the second smallest is 2. So the function should return 2.\n\nWait, but in the case of [2,2,2], the second smallest is 2. So the function should return 2.\n\nSo, the function should return the second element in the sorted array, but only if it's different from the first. Otherwise, return undefined.\n\nWait, no. Because in the"], ["//You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n// of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n// Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n// For example:\n// >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n// 0\n// >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\")\n// 1\nfunction is_bored(S){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called is_bored that takes a string S and returns the number of boredoms in it. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\". Sentences are delimited by '.', '?', or '!'. So, for example, the string \"Hello world\" has no sentences, so the count is 0. The string \"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\" has one sentence starting with \"I\", so the count is 1.\n\nHmm, so the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Split the string into sentences. Each sentence is delimited by one of the punctuation marks: '.', '?', or '!'. So, I need to find all the positions in the string where these punctuation marks occur, and split the string into sentences based on these.\n\n2. For each sentence, check if it starts with the word \"I\". But wait, the sentence could be followed by a punctuation mark, like in the example. So, the sentence is considered to start with \"I\" if the first word is \"I\", regardless of what comes after.\n\n3. So, for each sentence, I need to extract the first word and check if it's \"I\". If it is, then it's a boredom.\n\nBut wait, how do I split the string into sentences? Because the sentences are delimited by '.', '?', or '!', but the sentences themselves are the parts between these delimiters. So, for example, the string \"Hello world. How are you?\" would be split into two sentences: \"Hello world\" and \"How are you\".\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Split the string into sentences by splitting on any of the punctuation marks '.', '?', or '!'. But wait, the punctuation marks are the delimiters, so the sentences are the substrings between these delimiters.\n\nWait, no. Because the sentences are delimited by these punctuation marks, so the sentences are the parts of the string that are between these delimiters. So, for example, the string \"Hello world. How are you?\" would be split into \"Hello world\" and \"How are you\".\n\nBut wait, the string could have multiple delimiters, like \"Hello. world. How are you?\" which would split into \"Hello\", \"world\", \"How are you\".\n\nSo, the way to split is to find all the occurrences of the punctuation marks and split the string into parts. But how to do that in Python?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to process the string by finding all the positions where the punctuation marks occur, and then split the string into sentences by taking the substrings between these positions.\n\nBut in Python, the split function can take a regular expression, so perhaps using the re module to split the string into sentences.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to split the string into sentences by using the punctuation marks as delimiters, but also considering that the sentences can end with a punctuation mark.\n\nWait, perhaps the sentences are the substrings that are between the punctuation marks, but each sentence is the substring that starts with a word and ends with a punctuation mark, except for the last sentence which may end with a punctuation mark.\n\nWait, no. Because the sentences are delimited by the punctuation marks, so each sentence is a substring that starts with a word and ends with a punctuation mark, except for the last sentence which may end with a punctuation mark.\n\nWait, no. For example, the string \"Hello world. How are you?\" is split into two sentences: \"Hello world\" and \"How are you\".\n\nBut the string \"Hello. world. How are you?\" is split into three sentences: \"Hello\", \"world\", \"How are you\".\n\nSo, the way to split is to find all the occurrences of the punctuation marks, and split the string into parts, each part being a sentence.\n\nBut how to do that in Python.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sentences are the substrings that are between the punctuation marks, but each sentence is the substring that starts with a word and ends with a punctuation mark, except for the last sentence which may end with a punctuation mark.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to do this is to split the string into tokens, where each token is either a word or a punctuation mark. Then, sentences are the sequences of words separated by punctuation marks.\n\nBut that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sentences are the substrings that start with a word and end with a punctuation mark, except for the last sentence which may end with a punctuation mark.\n\n"], ["//Create a function that takes 3 numbers.\n// Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.\n// Returns false in any other cases.\n// Examples\n// >>> any_int(5, 2, 7)\n// true\n// >>> any_int(3, 2, 2)\n// false\n// >>> any_int(3, -2, 1)\n// true\n// >>> any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2)\n// false\nfunction any_int(x, y, z){ ... }\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns `true` if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.

The examples provided show that sometimes the largest prime is a single digit, sometimes it's a two-digit number, and so on.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Iterate through the array and find all the prime numbers.\n2. Among these primes, find the largest one.\n3. Once we have this largest prime, compute the sum of its digits.\n4. Return this sum.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to check if a number is prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, for each number in the array, I need to determine if it's a prime.\n\nBut wait, the array can have numbers that are not integers, but the problem statement says it's an array of integers. So, I can assume all elements are integers.\n\nSo, for each number in the array, I need to check if it's a prime. If it is, I add it to a list of primes. Then, from this list, I select the maximum prime. If there are no primes in the array, perhaps we return 0 or handle that case, but the problem examples don't show that. So, perhaps the array will always contain at least one prime.\n\nOnce I have the largest prime, I need to compute the sum of its digits. For example, if the largest prime is 13, the sum is 1 + 3 = 4. But wait, in the first example, the output is 10. Let's see:\n\nIn the first example, the array is [0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 181, 32, 4, 32, 3, 2, 32, 324, 4, 3].

Otherwise, it returns false. Also, if the object is empty, it should return false.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the object is empty. If it is, return false.\n\nThen, for each key in the object, I need to determine if the key is a string and whether it's all lowercase or all uppercase.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, the keys are strings, so I can directly access them.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the object is empty. If so, return false.\n\n2. For each key in the object:\n\n   a. Check if the key is a string.\n\n   b. If it's not a string, return false because the keys must be strings.\n\n   c. Then, check if the key is either all lowercase or all uppercase.\n\n3. If all keys meet the condition, return true. Otherwise, return false.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the key is a number or something else? According to the problem statement, the function should return false if the object is empty, but for other cases, the keys must be strings. So, if any key is not a string, we return false.\n\nSo, the function can proceed as:\n\n- If the object is empty, return false.\n\n- For each key in the object:\n\n   - If the key is not a string, return false.\n\n   - Then, check if the key is all lowercase or all uppercase.\n\n- If all keys pass the check, return true.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, check if the object is empty. In JavaScript, an empty object is when the object's length is 0.\n\nSo, if (Object.keys(dict).length === 0) return false.\n\nThen, for each key in Object.keys(dict):\n\n   if (typeof key !== 'string') return false;\n\n   then, check if the key is all lowercase or all uppercase.\n\nSo, how to check if a string is all lowercase or all uppercase.\n\nIn JavaScript, you can use the String.prototype.toLowerCase() and String.prototype.toUpperCase() methods.\n\nSo, for a given key, if key.toLowerCase() === key, then it's all lowercase.\n\nIf key.toUpperCase() === key, then it's all uppercase.\n\nBut wait, what about empty strings? Because an empty string is both all lowercase and all uppercase.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the keys are strings, but an empty string is a string. So, if a key is an empty string, it's both lowercase and uppercase.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the examples don't include empty strings, but the function should return false if the object is empty, regardless of the keys.\n\nWait, the function should return false if the object is empty, regardless of the keys. So, if the object is empty, regardless of the keys, return false.\n\nSo, for example, if the object is {}, return false.\n\nBut if the object is {}, but the keys are, say, numbers, but the object is empty, then the function returns false.\n\nSo, the function's first step is to check if the object is empty. If yes, return false.\n\nThen, for each key in the object:\n\n   if the key is not a string, return false.\n\n   then, check if the key is all lowercase or all uppercase.\n\nSo, for each key:\n\n   if (key === key.toLowerCase()) \u2192 all lowercase.\n\n   else if (key === key.toUpperCase()) \u2192 all uppercase.\n\n   else \u2192 not all same case.\n\nSo, for each key, we need to check if it is either all lowercase or all uppercase.\n\nSo, in code:\n"], ["//Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n\n// integers that are prime numbers and less than n.\n// for example:\n// >>> count_up_to(5)\n// [2, 3]\n// >>> count_up_to(11)\n// [2, 3, 5, 7]\n// >>> count_up_to(0)\n// []\n// >>> count_up_to(20)\n// [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]\n// >>> count_up_to(1)\n// []\n// >>> count_up_to(18)\n// [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]\nfunction count_up_to(n){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a function called count_up_to that takes a non-negative integer n and returns an array of the first n prime numbers that are less than n. Hmm, wait, no, the problem says less than n. Wait, let me check the examples.\n\nIn the first example, count_up_to(5) returns [2,3], which are both less than 5. So the primes are primes less than n. So for n=5, the primes less than 5 are 2,3. So the function returns the first n primes that are less than n.\n\nWait, but in the example count_up_to(11) returns [2,3,5,7], which are all less than 11. So the function is supposed to return the first n primes that are less than n.\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? Then the primes less than 1 are none, so the array is empty.\n\nSo the function needs to generate primes less than n, and collect the first n of them.\n\nBut wait, the function is supposed to return the first n primes that are less than n. So for n=5, the primes less than 5 are 2,3. So the array is [2,3], which is the first 2 primes.\n\nWait, but the function is called count_up_to(n), and the examples show that for n=5, it returns [2,3], which are the first two primes less than 5.\n\nSo the function needs to generate primes less than n, and collect the first n of them.\n\nWait, but what if n is 0? Then the array is empty.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For a given n, generate all primes less than n.\n\n2. From these primes, take the first n primes.\n\n3. Return them as an array.\n\nBut wait, for n=20, the primes less than 20 are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19. So the first 8 primes, but the function returns 8 elements. So the function is to return the first n primes that are less than n.\n\nWait, but in the example count_up_to(18) returns [2,3,5,7,11,13,17], which are the first 7 primes less than 18. So the function returns the first n primes that are less than n.\n\nWait, but wait, 17 is less than 18, yes. So the function is to return the first n primes that are less than n.\n\nSo the function needs to generate primes less than n, and collect the first n of them.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? Then there are no primes less than 1, so the array is empty.\n\nSo the function needs to:\n\n- Generate all primes less than n.\n\n- From these, take the first n primes.\n\n- Return them as an array.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n.\" So the function is to return the first n primes that are less than n.\n\nSo the function is to generate the primes in order, and collect the first n primes that are less than n.\n\nSo, for example, when n=5, the primes less than 5 are 2,3. So the first 2 primes are [2,3].\n\nWhen n=11, the primes less than 11 are 2,3,5,7. So the first 4 primes are [2,3,5,7].\n\nWait, but the example for count_up_to(11) is [2,3,5,7], which is 4 elements, which is the first 4 primes less than 11.\n\nSo the function is to return the first n primes that are less than n.\n\nSo the function needs to:\n\n1. Generate all primes less than n.\n\n2. From these, take the first n primes.\n\n3. Return them as an array.\n\nBut wait, what if n"], ["//Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n// the product of their unit digits.\n// Assume the input is always valid.\n// Examples:\n// >>> multiply(148, 412)\n// 16\n// >>> multiply(19, 28)\n// 72\n// >>> multiply(2020, 1851)\n// 0\n// >>> multiply(14, -15)\n// 20\nfunction multiply(a, b){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called multiply that takes two integers and returns the product of their unit digits. Hmm, okay, so the unit digit is the last digit of a number. So for example, the unit digit of 148 is 8, and the unit digit of 412 is 2. So 8 multiplied by 2 is 16, which is the first example.\n\nSo, how do I get the unit digit of a number in JavaScript? Well, one way is to use modulo 10. Because when you take a number modulo 10, you get the remainder, which is the unit digit. For example, 148 % 10 is 8, 412 % 10 is 2, etc.\n\nSo, for each of the two numbers, a and b, I can get their unit digits by doing a % 10 and b % 10. Then, I multiply those two unit digits together, and return that product.\n\nWait, but what about negative numbers? Because if a is negative, like -14, then -14 % 10 in JavaScript is 6, right? Because in JavaScript, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the dividend. So, for example, -14 % 10 is 6, because 10 * (-2) is -20, and -14 - (-20) is 6. So, that's correct. So, for a negative number, the unit digit is still correctly calculated.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Get the unit digit of a by doing a % 10.\n2. Get the unit digit of b by doing b % 10.\n3. Multiply these two unit digits together.\n4. Return the result.\n\nSo, putting this into code.\n\nThe function multiply(a, b) will do:\n\nlet unitA = a % 10;\nlet unitB = b % 10;\nreturn unitA * unitB;\n\nWait, but what if a or b is negative? Let's test with the example multiply(14, -15). The unit digits are 4 and 5, so 4 * 5 is 20, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: multiply(2020, 1851). 2020's unit digit is 0, 1851's is 1. 0 * 1 is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: multiply(19, 28). 9 * 8 is 72, correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what about when a or b is zero? For example, multiply(0, 5) should return 0, which is correct.\n\nWhat about when a is 0 and b is 0? 0 * 0 is 0, correct.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nSo, the function is:\n"], ["//Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.\n// For example:\n// >>> count_upper(\"aBCdEf\")\n// 1\n// >>> count_upper(\"abcdefg\")\n// 0\n// >>> count_upper(\"dBBE\")\n// 0\nfunction count_upper(s){ ... }\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function called count_upper that takes a string s and returns the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. Hmm, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, what's an uppercase vowel? Well, vowels are a, e, i, o, u, and they can be uppercase or lowercase. But in this problem, we're only considering uppercase vowels. So, 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' are the ones we're interested in.\n\nNow, the indices. The string is zero-based, right? So the first character is index 0, which is even. Then index 1 is odd, index 2 is even, and so on.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, I need to check two things: is it an uppercase vowel, and is its index even?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. For each character, check if it is an uppercase vowel.\n3. Also, check if its index is even.\n4. If both conditions are true, increment the count.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I can loop through each character with their index. For each index, check if the character is in the set {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}.\n\nWait, but in Python, strings are zero-based, so index 0 is the first character. So, for each i in range(len(s)), check if s[i] is uppercase and in vowels.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\ndef count_upper(s):\n    count = 0\n    vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char in vowels and i % 2 == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nWait, let me test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example: count_upper(\"aBCdEf\") should return 1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string is 'aBCdEf' which is 6 characters.\n\nIndices 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nCharacters:\n\n0: 'a' \u2192 lowercase, not vowel.\n1: 'B' \u2192 uppercase, but not a vowel.\n2: 'C' \u2192 uppercase, not a vowel.\n3: 'd' \u2192 lowercase, not vowel.\n4: 'E' \u2192 uppercase, vowel. Index 4 is even. So count +=1.\n5: 'f' \u2192 lowercase, not vowel.\n\nSo total count is 1. Correct.\n\nSecond example: count_upper(\"abcdefg\") \u2192 0.\n\nEach character is lowercase, so no uppercase vowels. So count is 0. Correct.\n\nThird example: count_upper(\"dBBE\") \u2192 0.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIndices 0,1,2,3.\n\n0: 'd' \u2192 lowercase.\n1: 'B' \u2192 uppercase, not vowel.\n2: 'B' \u2192 uppercase, not vowel.\n3: 'E' \u2192 uppercase, vowel. Index 3 is odd. So no count. So total 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: count_upper(\"AEIOU\") \u2192 3.\n\nEach character is uppercase, and their indices are 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, index 0: 'A' \u2192 vowel, count +=1.\nindex 1: 'E' \u2192 vowel, but index is odd, so no.\nindex 2: 'I' \u2192 vowel, index even \u2192 count +=1.\nindex 3: 'O' \u2192 vowel, index odd \u2192 no.\nindex 4: 'U' \u2192 vowel, index even \u2192 count +=1.\n\nTotal count is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: count_upper(\"aAeEiI\") \u2192 let's see.\n\nIndices 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nCharacters:\n\n0: 'a' \u2192 lowercase, not vowel.\n1: 'A' \u2192 uppercase, vowel. Index 1 is odd \u2192 no.\n2: 'e' \u2192 vowel, index even \u2192 count +=1.\n3: 'E' \u2192 vowel, index odd \u2192 no.\n4: 'i' \u2192 vowel, index even \u2192 count +=1.\n5: 'I' \u2192 vowel, index odd \u2192 no.\n\nSo total count is 2.\n\nWait, but wait: the string is \"aAeEiI\", which is 6 characters.\n\nWait, no, wait: \"aAeEiI\" is 6 letters? Let me count: a, A,"], ["//Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number\n// and returns the closest integer to it.

For example closest_integer(\"14.5\") should\n// return 15 and closest_integer(\"-14.5\") should return -15.\nfunction closest_integer(value){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to create a function called closest_integer that takes a string representing a number and returns the closest integer. If the number is exactly halfway between two integers, I should round away from zero. \n\nLet me think about the examples given. \n\nFor \"10\", the output is 10. That makes sense because 10 is an integer. \n\nFor \"15.3\", the output is 15. So, 15.3 is closer to 15 than to 16. \n\nBut wait, 15.3 is 0.3 away from 15 and 0.7 away from 16. So, 15 is closer. \n\nAnother example is \"14.5\" which should return 15. Because 14.5 is exactly halfway between 14 and 15. So, according to the note, we round away from zero, which in this case is 15. Similarly, \"-14.5\" should return -15 because it's halfway between -14 and -15, and we round away from zero.\n\nSo, the function needs to handle both positive and negative numbers, and also numbers that are exactly halfway between two integers.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input string into a number. So, I can use Number(value) to convert it.\n\nOnce I have the number, I need to determine the closest integer. But how?\n\nI think the approach is to find the integer part and then see if the decimal part is 0.5 or more. If it is, round up. If it's less than 0.5, round down. But wait, what about when the number is negative?\n\nWait, let's think about the steps:\n\n1. Convert the input string to a number.\n\n2. Find the integer part and the decimal part.\n\n3. If the decimal part is >= 0.5, round up to the next integer.\n\n4. If the decimal part is < 0.5, round down to the previous integer.\n\nBut wait, what about when the number is exactly halfway between two integers, like 14.5 or -14.5?\n\nIn that case, we need to round away from zero. So, for 14.5, we round to 15. For -14.5, we round to -15.\n\nSo, the rule is: if the decimal part is >= 0.5, round up. If it's less than 0.5, round down. But wait, what about when the number is an integer? Then, the decimal part is 0, so we just return it.\n\nBut wait, what about numbers like 10.5? That's halfway between 10 and 11. So, according to the rule, we should round up to 11. Similarly, -10.5 should round to -11.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Convert the input to a number.\n\n- Find the integer part and the decimal part.\n\n- If the decimal part is >= 0.5, round up.\n\n- Else, round down.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, I can split the string into its integer and fractional parts. But perhaps a better approach is to use Math functions.\n\nWait, another approach is to calculate the distance to the nearest integer and see which is smaller.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to use the built-in functions in JavaScript.\n\nWait, in JavaScript, there's a method called Math.round() which rounds a number to the nearest integer. But wait, Math.round(14.5) is 15, which is correct. Math.round(15.3) is 15. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait: Math.round(14.5) is 15, which is correct. Math.round(15.3) is 15, which is correct. So, perhaps using Math.round() is sufficient.\n\nWait, but let's test some cases.\n\nCase 1: \"10\" \u2192 10 \u2192"], ["//Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n// The first level has n stones.\n// The number of stones in the next level is:\n// - the next odd number if n is odd.\n// - the next even number if n is even.\n// Return the number of stones in each level in an array, where element at index\n// i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n// Examples:\n// >>> make_a_pile(3)\n// [3, 5, 7]\nfunction make_a_pile(n){ ... }"], ["//You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces.

The words are separated by commas or spaces. So, for example, if the input is \"Hi, my name is John\", the output should be [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]. Similarly, if the input is \"One, two, three, four, five, six\", the output is [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"].\n\nHmm, so the first thing I need to do is split the string into parts wherever there's a comma or a space. But wait, how do I handle both commas and spaces as separators? Because if I split on either, I might end up with some empty strings or duplicates.\n\nWait, no. Because the words are separated by either commas or spaces. So, the string is a sequence of words separated by either commas or spaces. So, the splitting can be done by using a regular expression that matches either a comma or a space.\n\nSo, the regular expression would be something like /,\\s*/ or /[\\s,]/. Wait, but that might not capture all cases. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can split the string into parts using a regular expression that matches either a comma or a space. So, the pattern would be /,\\s*/ or /[\\s,]/. But wait, if I split on either, I might get empty strings if the string starts or ends with a comma or space.\n\nWait, no. Because in the examples given, the input strings don't have leading or trailing commas or spaces. So, perhaps the function can assume that the input string is properly formatted, with words separated by commas or spaces, and no leading or trailing separators.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps I should handle cases where the string starts or ends with a comma or space.\n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to split the string into parts using a regular expression that matches either a comma or a space, and then filter out any empty strings that might result from the split.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the split method with a regex that captures both commas and spaces as separators, and then filter out any empty elements.\n\nWait, let's think about how to split the string into words. The string is a sequence of words separated by either commas or spaces. So, the words are the tokens that are not commas or spaces.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to split the string into parts wherever a comma or space occurs, and then collect all the non-empty parts.\n\nBut wait, if I split on commas, I might get empty strings if the string starts with a comma. Similarly, if I split on spaces, I might get empty strings if the string ends with a space.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to split the string into parts using a regex that matches either a comma or a space, and then filter out any empty strings.\n\nSo, the regular expression would be /,\\s*/ which matches either a comma followed by any number of spaces, or a space followed by any number of commas.\n\nWait, no. Because commas and spaces are the separators. So, the correct regex would be to split on either a comma or a space. So, the regex would be /,\\s*/ or /[\\s,]/.\n\nWait, but the split method in JavaScript returns an array of the substrings between the matches. So, if I split on /,\\s*/ then the resulting array will have the words as elements, but also include the separators as elements. Wait, no, because the split method returns the parts between the separators. So, for example, \"a,b,c\".split(/,\\s*/) would give [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], because the split is on the commas, and the separators are the commas and spaces.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the split method with a regex that includes commas and spaces as separators will split the string into parts wherever a comma or space occurs. So, for example, \"a, b, c\".split(/,\\s*/) would give [\"a\", \" b\", \" c\"], which is not what we want. Because we want to split on commas or spaces, and get the words as separate elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a positive lookbehind or lookahead to split on either commas or spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a regex that matches either a comma"], ["//This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the\n// biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive.

So, the first step is to check if n > m, return -1.\n\nNow, for the average calculation. The average of a sequence of consecutive integers from a to b is equal to (a + b)/2. Because the sum of consecutive numbers is (number of terms) * (first + last)/2, and the average is sum divided by number of terms, which is (a + b)/2.\n\nSo, the average is (n + m)/2.\n\nBut wait, what if n and m are not consecutive? For example, n=1, m=5: the numbers are 1,2,3,4,5. The average is (1+5)/2 = 3. So, the average is 3, which is an integer, so no rounding needed.\n\nAnother example: n=10, m=20. The average is (10+20)/2 = 15. So, binary is 1111.\n\nAnother example: n=20, m=33. The average is (20+33)/2 = 26.5. Rounded to nearest integer is 27. Binary is 11011.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the average is 3, which is an integer, so no rounding needed. So, the function returns \"0b11\".\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. If n > m, return -1.\n2. Else, compute the average as (n + m)/2.\n3. Round the average to the nearest integer.\n4. Convert that integer to binary, without leading zeros, and return it as a string prefixed with \"0b\".\n\nWait, but in the example, when n=7 and m=5, which is n > m, the function returns -1. So, the first condition is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check if n > m: return -1.\n- Else, compute average = (n + m) / 2.\n- Round the average to the nearest integer. But wait, how to handle when the average is a .5? For example, 3.5 would round to 4, 2.5 would round to 3, etc.\n- Then, convert that integer to binary, without leading zeros, and return as a string with \"0b\" prefix.\n\nWait, but in the example, rounded_avg(1,5) returns \"0b11\", which is 3 in binary. So, the function correctly returns the binary string.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, the function is called rounded_avg(n, m). So, in JavaScript, we can write:\n"], ["//Given an array of positive integers x. return a sorted array of all \n// elements that hasn't any even digit.\n// Note: Returned array should be sorted in increasing order.\n// For example:\n// >>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])\n// [1, 15, 33]\n// >>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])\n// []\nfunction unique_digits(x){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's see. The task is to take an array of positive integers and return a sorted array of all elements that have no even digits. So, for each number in the array, I need to check if any of its digits are even. If none are even, include it in the result. Then, return the result sorted in increasing order.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input array.\n2. For each element, check each of its digits to see if any are even.\n3. If none of the digits are even, include the element in the result array.\n4. After processing all elements, sort the result array in increasing order.\n5. Return the sorted result array.\n\nWait, but the result array needs to be sorted in increasing order. So, the final step is to sort the result array.\n\nSo, how do I check each digit of a number? Well, for a given number, I can repeatedly extract the last digit using modulo 10, then divide the number by 10, until the number becomes zero. For each extracted digit, I can check if it's even. If any digit is even, the number is excluded.\n\nLet me think about the example given:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [15, 33, 1422, 1]\nProcessing each number:\n- 15: digits are 1 and 5. Both are odd. So, include 15.\n- 33: digits are 3 and 3. Both are odd. Include 33.\n- 1422: digits are 1,4,2,2. 4 and 2 are even. So, exclude.\n- 1: digit is 1. Odd. Include.\n\nSo, the result is [1, 15, 33], which is already sorted. So, the output is correct.\n\nAnother example:\nInput: [152, 323, 1422, 10]\nProcessing each number:\n- 152: digits are 1,5,2. 2 is even. Exclude.\n- 323: digits are 3,2,3. 2 is even. Exclude.\n- 1422: digits include 4 and 2. Exclude.\n- 10: digits are 1 and 0. 0 is even. So, exclude.\n\nSo, the result is empty.\n\nSo, the function needs to process each number, check if any digit is even, and collect those that don't have any even digits.\n\nNow, how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nLet's outline the steps in code:\n\nFunction unique_digits(x) {\n    let result = [];\n    for (let num of x) {\n        let isEven = false;\n        let n = num;\n        while (n > 0) {\n            let digit = n % 10;\n            if (digit % 2 === 0) {\n                isEven = true;\n                break;\n            }\n            n = Math.floor(n / 10);\n        }\n        if (!isEven) {\n            result.push(num);\n        }\n    }\n    result.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n    return result;\n}\n\nWait, but wait. What about the number 0? Well, 0 is even, so any number containing 0 would be excluded. But in the problem statement, the array is of positive integers, so 0 is not present. So, no problem.\n\nWait, but what about numbers like 10? 10 has a 0, which is even, so 10 is excluded.\n\nAnother test case: [22, 33, 44]. All have even digits, so result is empty.\n\nAnother test case: [13, 25, 67]. 13 has 1 and 3, both odd. 25 has 2 and 5. 67 has 6 and 7. So, all are included. So, result is [13,25,67].\n\nWait, but 25 has 2, which is even. So, 25 is excluded. So, the result is [13,67].\n\nWait, no. Let"], ["//Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n// reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n// \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n// For example:\n// >>> by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3])\n// [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n// If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n// >>> by_length([])\n// []\n// If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n// >>> by_length([1, -1, 55])\n// [\"One\"]\nfunction by_length(arr){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe have an array of integers. We need to sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive. Then, reverse the resulting array. After that, replace each digit with its corresponding name from the array [\"One\", \"Two\", ..., \"Nine\"]. If the array is empty, return empty. Also, ignore any strange numbers, meaning if the number is not between 1 and 9, we ignore it. Finally, the order is first sort, then reverse, then replace each digit with its name.\n\nWait, the problem says \"sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive\". So, first, we filter the array to include only integers between 1 and 9, then sort them, then reverse, then replace each digit with its name.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the example again.\n\nIn the example, the input is [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]. The output is [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"].\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal array: [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]\n\nFirst, we filter the array to include only numbers between 1 and 9. So all elements are in that range.\n\nThen, we sort them. So the sorted array is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8].\n\nThen, we reverse it. So the reversed array is [8,5,4,3,2,2,1,1].\n\nThen, replace each digit with its corresponding name.\n\nSo 8 becomes \"Eight\", 5 becomes \"Five\", 4 becomes \"Four\", 3 becomes \"Three\", 2 becomes \"Two\", 2 becomes \"Two\", 1 becomes \"One\", 1 becomes \"One\".\n\nSo the output is [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"], which matches the example.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Filter the array to include only integers between 1 and 9, inclusive.\n\n2. Sort this filtered array in ascending order.\n\n3. Reverse the sorted array.\n\n4. For each digit in the reversed array, replace it with the corresponding name.\n\nSo, the function by_length(arr) needs to perform these steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, handle the case when the array is empty. Return empty.\n\nElse, process the array.\n\nStep 1: Filter the array.\n\nWe can create a new array that includes only elements where element is between 1 and 9, inclusive.\n\nSo, for each element in arr, if (element >=1 && element <=9), include it.\n\nStep 2: Sort the filtered array in ascending order.\n\nSo, sorted_arr = filtered_arr.sort((a,b) => a - b)\n\nStep 3: Reverse the sorted array.\n\nreversed_arr = sorted_arr.reverse()\n\nStep 4: Replace each digit with its corresponding name.\n\nWe need a mapping from each digit to its name.\n\nSo, create an object:\n\ndigit_to_name = {\n    '0': 'Zero',\n    '1': 'One',\n    '2': 'Two',\n    '3': 'Three',\n    '4': 'Four',\n    '5': 'Five',\n    '6': 'Six',\n    '7': 'Seven',\n    '8': 'Eight',\n    '9': 'Nine'\n}\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"], which is the names of the digits in the reversed array.\n\nSo, for each digit in reversed_arr, we replace it with the corresponding name.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the reversed array is [8,5,4,3,2"], ["//Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n// and returns an array of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even\n// or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\n// i starts from 1.\n// the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\n// Example:\n// >>> f(5)\n// [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\nfunction f(n){ ... }"], ["//Given a positive integer n, return an array that has the number of even and odd\n// integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n// Example 1:\n// >>> even_odd_palindrome(3)\n// [1, 2]\n// Explanation:\n// Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n// Example 2:\n// >>> even_odd_palindrome(12)\n// [4, 6]\n// Explanation:\n// Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n// Note:\n// 1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n// 2. returned array has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\nfunction even_odd_palindrome(n){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to write a function called even_odd_palindrome that takes a positive integer n and returns an array with two elements: the count of even integer palindromes and the count of odd integer palindromes within the range 1 to n, inclusive.\n\nLet me look at the examples to understand better.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 3\nOutput: [1, 2]\nExplanation: The integers are 1, 2, 3. Among these, 2 is even and 1 and 3 are odd. So even count is 1, odd count is 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 12\nOutput: [4, 6]\nExplanation: The palindromes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. Even numbers are 2,4,6,8 (4 in total), and the rest 6 are odd.\n\nSo, the function needs to generate all palindromic numbers from 1 to n, count how many are even and how many are odd, and return them in an array as [even_count, odd_count].\n\nFirst, I need to generate all palindromic numbers up to n. Then, for each of them, determine if it's even or odd, and count accordingly.\n\nBut how to generate all palindromic numbers up to n?\n\nI think the approach is to generate all possible palindromes and check if they are <= n.\n\nBut generating all palindromes can be done by considering the number of digits. For each possible length, generate all possible palindromes and check if they are <=n.\n\nAlternatively, for each number from 1 to n, check if it's a palindrome and then determine if it's even or odd.\n\nBut for n up to 1e3, this approach is feasible because 1e3 is manageable.\n\nWait, but for n=1e3, the maximum number is 1000. So, checking each number from 1 to 1000 is manageable.\n\nSo, perhaps the simplest approach is to iterate through each number from 1 to n, check if it's a palindrome, and then count even and odd.\n\nBut wait, for n=1e3, that's 1000 iterations, which is trivial.\n\nBut for n=1e6, it's 1e6 iterations, which may be acceptable, but for n=1e3, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way to generate palindromes without checking each number.\n\nLet me think about how to generate palindromes.\n\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for a number with d digits, the first half determines the second half.\n\nFor example, for 3-digit numbers, the first digit is the same as the last digit, and the middle digit can be anything.\n\nSo, to generate all palindromes up to n, we can generate them by constructing the first half and mirroring it.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think about the number of digits in n.\n\nFor example, if n is 3 digits, then the palindromes can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit.\n\nWait, but 1-digit numbers are also palindromes.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to generate all possible palindromes with 1 digit, 2 digits, up to the number of digits in n.\n\nBut how to generate them?\n\nLet me think about the number of digits in n.\n\nSuppose n has d digits.\n\nFor each possible length from 1 to d:\n\n- For length 1: all numbers from 1 to 9 are palindromes.\n\n- For length "], ["//Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns\n// the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n// If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n// e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n// >>> count_nums([])\n// 0\n// >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11])\n// 1\n// >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2])\n// 3\nfunction count_nums(arr){ ... }\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function called `count_nums` that takes an array of integers and returns the number of elements whose sum of digits is greater than 0.

Our task is to determine if it's possible to get the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following operation any number of times: right shift any number of times. A right shift moves all elements to the right, and the last element comes to the first position.\n\nIf it's possible, return true; else, return false.\n\nIf the array is empty, return true.\n\nNote: The given array is guaranteed to have unique elements.\n\nExamples:\n\nExample 1:\nmove_one_ball([3,4,5,1,2]) returns true.\nExplanation: By performing 2 right shift operations, the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5], which is sorted.\n\nExample 2:\nmove_one_ball([3,5,4,1,2]) returns false.\nExplanation: It's not possible to get a sorted array by any number of right shifts.\n\nSo, the key is to find whether the array can be rotated right by some number of positions to become non-decreasing.\n\nHow can we approach this?\n\nLet's think about the properties of the array after right shifts.\n\nEach right shift moves the last element to the front. So, for example, after one right shift, the array becomes [arr[N-1], arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[N-2]].\n\nIf we perform k right shifts, the array becomes [arr[N - k], arr[N - k + 1], ..., arr[N-1], arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[N - k - 1]].\n\nWait, no. Wait, each right shift is a single step. So, after k right shifts, the array is [arr[N - k], arr[N - k + 1], ..., arr[N-1], arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[N - k - 1]].\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the array is [a, b, c, d, e]. After one right shift, it becomes [e, a, b, c, d]. After two right shifts, it becomes [d, e, a, b, c]. So, after k right shifts, the array is [arr[N - k], arr[N - k + 1], ..., arr[N-1], arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[N - k - 1]].\n\nWait, no. Wait, for the array [a, b, c, d, e], after one right shift, it's [e, a, b, c, d].

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. The function is called exchange and takes two arrays as input. I need to return \"YES\" if it's possible, otherwise \"NO\". The key is that after exchanging some elements, all elements in lst1 must be even.\n\nLet me think about the conditions that need to be met. For each element in lst1, it can either stay in lst1 or be swapped with an element from lst2. But the goal is to make all elements in lst1 even.\n\nWait, but what if the elements in lst1 are already even? Then, no problem. But if they are odd, we need to swap them with even elements from lst2.\n\nSo, the approach is: count the number of odd elements in lst1. If there are zero odd elements, then it's already possible, so return \"YES\". If there are some odd elements, then we need to check if there are enough even elements in lst2 to swap with them.\n\nWait, but what if the number of odd elements in lst1 is more than the number of even elements in lst2? Then it's impossible, so return \"NO\".\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of odd elements in lst1.\n2. Count the number of even elements in lst2.\n3. If the count of odd elements in lst1 is zero, return \"YES\".\n4. Else, if the count of even elements in lst2 is less than the count of odd elements in lst1, return \"NO\".\n5. Otherwise, return \"YES\".\n\nWait, but what about the case where the even elements in lst2 are more than the odd elements in lst1? Then, we can swap all the odd elements in lst1 with even elements from lst2, and the remaining even elements in lst2 can stay as they are. So, in that case, it's possible.\n\nSo, the condition is: the number of even elements in lst2 must be at least the number of odd elements in lst1.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFirst example: exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])\nlst1 has two odd elements (1 and 3). lst2 has two even elements (2 and 4). So, 2 <= 2, so return \"YES\".\n\nSecond example: exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])\nlst1 has two odd elements (1 and 3). lst2 has two even elements (4 and 2). So, 2 <= 2, so return \"YES\". Wait, but the sample output is \"NO\". Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, wait, let me re-examine the second example. The sample input is [1,2,3,4] and [1,5,3,4]. So, lst1 is [1,2,3,4], which has 1,3 as odd. lst2 is [1,5,3,4], which has 1,5,3 as odd, and 4 as even. So, the count of odd elements in lst1 is 2. The count of even elements in lst2 is 1. So, 2 > 1, so it's impossible. So, the function should return \"NO\".\n\nWait, but according to my earlier logic, the function would return \"NO\" because 2 > 1. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: exchange([1,3,5], [2,4,6]). lst1 has 3 odds, lst2 has 0 evens. So, "], ["//Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return an object\n// of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.\n// If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.\n// Example:\n// >>> histogram(\"a b c\")\n// {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 1}\n// >>> histogram(\"a b b a\")\n// {\"a\": 2, \"b\": 2}\n// >>> histogram(\"a b c a b\")\n// {\"a\": 2, \"b\": 2}\n// >>> histogram(\"b b b b a\")\n// {\"b\": 4}\n// >>> histogram(\"\")\n// {}\nfunction histogram(test){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's see. The task is to write a JavaScript function called histogram that takes a string as input and returns an object (an object in JavaScript is called a Map, but in the examples, it's shown as an object with keys and values, so perhaps a plain object). The function should count the frequency of each lowercase letter in the input string, and return the letter(s) with the highest frequency. If there are multiple letters with the same highest frequency, return all of them in an object. If the input string is empty, return an empty object.\n\nLet me look at the examples:\n\nFirst example: histogram(\"a b c\") returns an object where each letter has a count of 1. So, the output is {a:1, b:1, c:1}.\n\nSecond example: histogram(\"a b b a\") returns {a:2, b:2}.\n\nThird example: histogram(\"a b c a b\") returns {a:2, b:2}.\n\nFourth example: histogram(\"b b b b a\") returns {b:4}.\n\nFifth example: histogram(\"\") returns {}.\n\nSo, the function needs to process the input string, count the occurrences of each letter, find the maximum count, collect all letters that have that count, and return them as an object.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input string. The input is a string where each word is a space-separated lowercase letter. So, for example, \"a b c\" is split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], each being a single letter. So, the first step is to split the input string into an array of words, then split each word into individual characters, but wait, each word is a single letter, so each word is a single character. So, perhaps the input can be split into an array of characters, each being a single letter.\n\nWait, but the input is a string like \"a b c\", which is split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], each of which is a single character. So, perhaps the first step is to split the input string into an array of characters, regardless of whether they are separated by spaces or not. Wait, no, because the input is space-separated, so each word is a single letter. So, the input is a string where each word is a single lowercase letter, separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for example, \"a b c\" is split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], each of which is a single character. So, the first step is to split the input string into an array of words, then split each word into individual characters, but since each word is a single character, perhaps it's easier to split the entire string into an array of characters, ignoring spaces.\n\nWait, no. Because the input is space-separated, so \"a b c\" is split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], each of which is a single character. So, the function can split the string into an array of characters, regardless of spaces. So, perhaps the first step is to split the string into an array of characters, ignoring spaces.\n\nWait, but the input is space-separated, so each word is a single character. So, for example, \"a b c\" is split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], each of which is a single character.

So, the function can split the string into an array of characters, ignoring spaces.\n\nWait, but in the function, the input is a string, and the function is supposed to process it. So, perhaps the first step is to split the input string into an array of characters, ignoring spaces.\n\nSo, for example, the input \"a b c\" is split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], each of which is a single character. So, the function can split the string into an array of characters, ignoring spaces.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, the split method can be used to split the string"], ["//Task\n// We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c\n// then check if the result string is palindrome.\n// A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.\n// You should return an array containing the result string and true/false for the check.\n// Example\n// >>> reverse_delete(\"abcde\", \"ae\")\n// [\"bcd\", false]\n// >>> reverse_delete(\"abcdef\", \"b\")\n// [\"acdef\", false]\n// >>> reverse_delete(\"abcdedcba\", \"ab\")\n// [\"cdedc\", true]\nfunction reverse_delete(s, c){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given two strings s and c. We have to delete all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c. Then, check if the resulting string is a palindrome. Return an array containing the result string and a boolean indicating whether it's a palindrome.\n\nExamples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \"abcde\", \"ae\"\nOutput: [\"bcd\", false]\n\nExplanation: We delete all characters in s that are in c. So, 'a' and 'e' are deleted. The remaining string is \"bcd\". Check if it's a palindrome: \"bcd\" is not equal to \"dcb\", so false.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \"abcdef\", \"b\"\nOutput: [\"acdef\", false]\n\nExplanation: Delete 'b', so the string becomes \"acdef\". Check if it's a palindrome: \"acdef\" vs \"fedca\" \u2014 not the same, so false.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: \"abcdedcba\", \"ab\"\nOutput: [\"cdedc\", true]\n\nExplanation: Delete 'a' and 'b' from s. So, the string becomes \"cdedc\". Check if it's a palindrome: yes.\n\nSo, the task is to:\n\n1. Process the string s by removing all characters that are present in c.\n2. Check if the resulting string is a palindrome.\n3. Return the resulting string and whether it's a palindrome.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, process s by removing all characters in c. So, for each character in s, if it's present in c, we remove it. How can we do that?\n\nWe can create a new string that includes only the characters from s that are not present in c.\n\nIn JavaScript, we can do this by:\n\n- Converting c into a Set for O(1) lookups.\n- Then, iterate over each character in s, and include it in the result only if it is not present in the Set.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the filter method on s. For each character, check if it is in c's Set. If not, include it.\n\nSo, something like:\n\nlet result = s.split('').filter(c => !c.includes(...)).join('');\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, the Set is an object, and the includes method is called on it. So, for each character in s, we can check if it is in c's Set.\n\nWait, but in the example, c is \"ae\", so the Set is {'a', 'e'}. So, for each character in s, if it is 'a' or 'e', we remove it.\n\nSo, the code for processing s would be:\n\nconst cSet = new Set(c);\nconst result = s.split('').filter(c => !cSet.has(c)).join('');\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nOnce we have the result string, we need to check if it's a palindrome.\n\nHow to check if a string is a palindrome in JavaScript?\n\nA string is a palindrome if it is equal to its reverse. So, we can reverse the string and compare it to the original.\n\nSo, let's get the reversed string:\n\nconst reversed = result.split('').reverse().join('');\n\nThen, check if result === reversed.\n\nIf yes, then it's a palindrome, else not.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n"], ["//Given an array of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return an array.\n// Each element i of the output should be \"the number of odd elements in the\n// string i of the input.\" where all the i's should be replaced by the number\n// of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.\n// >>> odd_count([\"1234567\"])\n// [\"the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.\"]\n// >>> odd_count([\"3\", \"11111111\"])\n// [\"the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.\", \"the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput.\"]\nfunction odd_count(lst){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's see.\n\nSo, the task is to take an array of strings where each string is composed of digits. For each string in the input array, I need to count the number of odd digits in that string.

Wait, no, looking at the example:\n\nWait, the first example's output is [\"the number of odd elements 4 in the string 1 of the input.\"]. So, the output is an array where each element is a string that starts with \"the number of odd elements \", then the count, then \" in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count. Wait, no, the output is just a string that starts with \"the number of odd elements \", then the count, then \" in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count. Or wait, perhaps the output is a string that is \"the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count. So, for each string in the input, the output is a string that starts with \"the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count of odd digits in that string.\n\nWait, in the first example, the input is [\"1234567\"], which has 4 odd digits. So the output is \"the number of odd elements 4 in the string 1 of the input.\" So, the output is a string that starts with \"the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count. So, the output is a string that is \"the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count of odd digits in the corresponding input string.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output is a string that starts with \"the number of odd elements 4 in the string 1 of the input.\" So, the count is 4, and the string is \"1\" in the input. So, the output is a string that is \"the number of odd elements 4 in the string 1 of the input.\"\n\nSo, for each string in the input, the output is a string that is \"the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count of odd digits in that string.\n\nSo, the output is an array where each element is a string that starts with \"the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count of odd digits in that string.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each string in the input array, count the number of odd digits (digits that are 1,3,5,7,9).\n\n2. For each string, create a new string that is \"the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.\" where i is the count from step 1.\n\n3. Collect all these new strings into an output array.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is [\"1234567\"], the count is 4, so the output is [\"the number of odd elements 4 in the string 1 of the input.\"].\n\nAnother example: [\"3\", \"11111111\"].\n\nFirst string: \"3\" has 1 odd digit.

Let's see. The task is to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of a given array of integers. Hmm, sub-array here refers to a contiguous part of the array, right? So, for example, in the first sample input [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4], the minimum sum is 1, which is the last element. In the second example, all elements are negative, so the minimum is the sum of all of them, which is -6.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the sub-array with the smallest possible sum. How can I do that efficiently?\n\nI remember that for finding the minimum sub-array sum, a common approach is to use Kadane's algorithm. But wait, Kadane's algorithm is typically used to find the maximum sub-array sum. Does it work for the minimum as well? Let me think.\n\nYes, Kadane's algorithm can be modified to find the minimum sub-array sum. The idea is to keep track of the current minimum sum ending at each position, and update the global minimum accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize two variables: current_min and global_min. Both can be set to the first element of the array.\n\n2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.\n\n3. For each element, calculate the current_min as the minimum between the current element and (current_min + current element). This is because the current sub-array could either start at the current element or continue from the previous sub-array.\n\n4. Update the global_min if the current_min is less than the current global_min.\n\n5. After processing all elements, the global_min will hold the minimum sub-array sum.\n\nWait, but what if all elements are negative? Then the global_min will be the sum of all elements, which is correct.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]\n\nInitialize current_min = 2, global_min = 2.\n\nNext element is 3: current_min = min(3, 2+3=5) \u2192 3. global_min remains 2.\n\nNext element is 4: current_min = min(4, 3+4=7) \u21924. global_min remains 2.\n\nNext element is 1: current_min = min(1, 4+1=5) \u21921. global_min is now 1.\n\nNext element is 2: current_min = min(2, 1+2=3) \u21922. global_min remains 1.\n\nNext element is 4: current_min = min(4, 2+4=6) \u21924. global_min remains 1.\n\nSo the result is 1, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample: [-1, -2, -3]\n\ncurrent_min starts at -1, global_min is -1.\n\nNext element is -2: current_min is min(-2, -1 + (-2) = -3) \u2192-3. global_min is now -3.\n\nNext element is -3: current_min is min(-3, -3 + (-3) = -6) \u2192-6. global_min is now -6.\n\nSo the result is -6, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]\n\nLet's see:\n\ncurrent_min starts at 1, global_min is 1.\n\nNext element is -2: current_min is min(-2, 1 + (-2) = -1) \u2192-2. global_min is now -2.\n\nNext element is 3: current_min is min(3, -2 +3=1) \u21921. global_min remains -2.\n\nNext element is -4: current_min is min(-4, 1 + (-4) = -3) \u2192-4. global_min is now -4.\n\nNext element is 5: current_min is min(5, -4 +5=1) \u21921. global_min remains -4.\n\nSo the minimum is -4, which is correct because the sub-array [-2, -4] sums to -6, but wait, no. Wait, the sub-array from index 1 to 3 is [-2, -4], sum is -6. Wait, but according to the algorithm, the minimum is -4.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well, and each 1 in a row represents a unit of water. Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water. All buckets have the same capacity. The task is to empty the wells using the buckets. We need to output the number of times we need to lower the buckets.\n\nHmm. So, each time we lower a bucket, it can extract a certain amount of water (up to its capacity). So, the process is: for each well, we can fill it with water, and then pour it into the buckets. Each time we pour, we can take as much as possible from the well, up to the bucket's capacity.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each time we lower the buckets, we can extract water. So, each lowering is a single operation. So, for each well, the number of times we need to lower the bucket is equal to the number of times we pour water from the well into the bucket. But each pour can take up to the bucket's capacity.\n\nWait, but the problem is to empty the wells. So, we need to pour all the water from each well into the buckets, but each time we pour, we can take as much as possible from the well, up to the bucket's capacity.\n\nWait, but the example 1:\n\nInput grid is [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], capacity 1.\n\nSo, the first well has 1 unit. So, we need to pour 1 unit into the bucket. That's one pour.\n\nSecond well has 1 unit. So, another pour.\n\nThird well has 4 units. Each pour can take 1 unit, so 4 pours.\n\nTotal is 1+1+4=6, which matches the example.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each well, count how many times we need to pour water into the bucket, which is the number of units in the well divided by the bucket's capacity, rounded up.\n\nWait, no. Because each pour can take up to the bucket's capacity. So, for a well with 5 units and capacity 2, you need 3 pours: 2, 2, 1.\n\nSo, the number of pours is (number of units + capacity - 1) // capacity.\n\nSo, for each well, the number of pours is (sum of 1s in the row + capacity -1) // capacity.\n\nWait, but wait. Each pour is a lowering of the bucket. So, each pour is one operation. So, the total number of operations is the sum over all wells of (sum of 1s in the row + capacity -1) // capacity.\n\nWait, but in example 2:\n\nInput grid is [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], capacity 2.\n\nSo, let's compute each well:\n\nFirst well: 2 units. 2 / 2 = 1 pour.\n\nSecond well: 0 units. 0 pours.\n\nThird well: 4 units. 4 / 2 = 2 pours.\n\nFourth well: 3 units. 3 / "], ["//In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to\n// number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.\n// For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.\n// It must be implemented like this:\n// >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])\n// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n// >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6])\n// [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\n// >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4])\n// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nfunction sort_array(arr){ ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe have to sort an array of non-negative integers. The sorting should be done based on the number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order. For numbers with the same number of ones, they should be sorted by their decimal value in ascending order.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. For each number in the array, calculate the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation.\n2. Sort the array based on the count of set bits in ascending order.\n3. If two numbers have the same count of set bits, sort them based on their original value in ascending order.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that for similar numbers of ones, sort based on decimal value. So, the primary key is the count of ones, and the secondary key is the number itself.\n\nSo, the sorting should be done in such a way that the array is sorted first by the number of ones in ascending order, and for numbers with the same number of ones, they are sorted in ascending order of their decimal values.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each element in the array, compute a tuple that contains the count of ones and the element itself.\n- Then, sort the array based on these tuples in ascending order.\n\nWait, but the array is being sorted, so perhaps it's better to create an array of objects or arrays that contain the count of ones and the original value, then sort based on these.\n\nBut in JavaScript, the sort function can take a comparator function. So, perhaps I can create a comparator function that, given two elements a and b, first compares the number of ones in a's binary representation and b's. If they are equal, then compare a and b.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Create a helper function that counts the number of set bits in a number.\n\nFunction countSetBits(n) {\n  let count = 0;\n  while (n > 0) {\n    count += n & 1;\n    n >>= 1;\n  }\n  return count;\n}\n\n2. Then, sort the array using a custom comparator.\n\nThe comparator function will compare two elements a and b.\n\nCompare the number of set bits in a and b.\n\nIf a has fewer set bits, it comes first.\n\nIf a and b have the same number of set bits, then compare a and b.

The function should return an array of all words from s that contain exactly n consonants, in the order they appear in the string s. If the string is empty, it returns an empty array. \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem thoroughly. The function needs to process each word in the string, count the consonants in each word, and collect those words that have exactly n consonants. The order of the words in the result should be the same as their order in the original string.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved:\n\n1. Split the input string into words. I'll need to split on spaces, but I should also consider that words might be separated by multiple spaces. So, using split(' ') might include empty strings, so I should filter them out.\n\n2. For each word, count the number of consonants. But wait, what defines a consonant here? Typically, consonants are letters that are not vowels. So vowels are a, e, i, o, u. I should ignore case, so both uppercase and lowercase letters should be considered.\n\n3. For each word, if the count of consonants equals n, add it to the result array.\n\n4. Return the result array.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each step.\n\nFirst, splitting the string into words. Using s.split(' ') will split on every space, but this includes empty strings if there are multiple spaces. So I can filter out any empty strings using filter(word => word !== '').\n\nNext, for each word, count the consonants. I'll loop through each character in the word, check if it's a consonant (not a vowel), and increment a counter. Alternatively, I can create a set of vowels and check if each character is not in that set.\n\nWait, but the problem says to count consonants, so I should make sure that I'm only counting letters that are consonants. So, vowels are a, e, i, o, u, regardless of case.\n\nSo, for each character in the word, if it's a letter and not a vowel, increment the consonant count.\n\nWait, but what about uppercase letters? Since the problem says to assume the input contains only letters and spaces, I don't need to handle uppercase letters. So I can convert each character to lowercase (or uppercase) to make the comparison case-insensitive.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize an empty array to hold the result words.\n- Split the string into words, filtering out any empty strings.\n- For each word:\n   - Initialize consonant count to 0.\n   - Loop through each character in the word:\n      - Convert to lowercase (or uppercase) to make the check case-insensitive.\n      - If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), skip it.\n      - Else, increment consonant count.\n   - If consonant count equals n, add the word to the result array.\n- Return the result array.\n\nWait, but the example given: in the first example, \"Mary had a little lamb\" with n=4, the output is [\"little\"]. Let's check:\n\nMary: M is consonant, a is vowel, y is sometimes considered a vowel, but in this problem, I think y is not considered a vowel. So Mary has M and r, so two consonants.

I need to check if it's possible to concatenate the two strings in some order such that the resulting string is good. A good string is one where all parentheses are balanced, meaning every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one in the correct order.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I think about is that for a string to be good, the total number of opening and closing parentheses must be equal, and at no point should the number of closing parentheses exceed the opening ones when scanning from left to right.\n\nSo, for example, the string \"(()())\" is good because it's balanced, but \"())(\" is not because at some point it has more closing than opening.\n\nSo, the problem is to check if either of the two possible concatenations (string1 + string2 or string2 + string1) results in a balanced string.\n\nBut wait, the strings can be of any length, right? So, for each possible order, I need to check if the concatenated string is balanced.\n\nBut how do I do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider all possible orders of concatenating the two strings. So, for each order, I need to check if the concatenated string is balanced.\n\nBut wait, the two strings are given as a list, so the order can be either of the two possible permutations.\n\nSo, for each permutation (there are two permutations: s1 + s2 and s2 + s1), I need to check if the concatenated string is balanced.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each permutation of the two strings (i.e., s1 + s2 and s2 + s1), check if the concatenated string is balanced.\n\n2. If any of the permutations is balanced, return \"Yes\". Otherwise, return \"No\".\n\nSo, the key is to implement a function that checks if a given string is balanced.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that function.\n\nA function is_balanced(s) that returns True if s is balanced, else False.\n\nHow to implement this:\n\n- Initialize a counter for the balance. Start at 0.\n\n- For each character in the string:\n\n   - If '(', increment the counter.\n\n   - If ')', decrement the counter.\n\n   - If the counter goes negative at any point, return False.\n\n- After processing all characters, if the counter is zero, return True. Else, False.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each permutation, I can call this function and see if it returns True.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\n- For each string in the list (let's call them s1 and s2):\n\n   - Create the two possible concatenations: s1 + s2 and s2 + s1.\n\n   - For each concatenation, check if it's balanced.\n\n   - If any of them is balanced, return \"Yes\".\n\n- If none of the concatenations are balanced, return \"No\".\n\nWait, but the list can have two strings, so for each permutation, we have to check both possibilities.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps:\n\ndef match_parens(lst):\n    s1, s2 = lst\n    for order in [('s1', 's2'), ('s2', 's1')]:\n        concatenated = order[0] + order[1]\n        if is_balanced(concatenated):\n            return \"Yes\"\n    return \"No\"\n\nAnd then the is_balanced function as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the two strings are of different lengths? For example, in the first sample input, the two strings are \"()(\" and \")\". So, the first concatenation is \"()(\", which is \"(()\", which is not balanced. The second concatenation is \")()\", which is balanced.\n\nSo, the code would correctly return \"Yes\".\n\nAnother sample input is [\"\")\", \")\"], which are both single closing parentheses. So, any concatenation would be \")(\", which is not balanced, so the code returns \"No\".\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases"], ["//Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted array \n// of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\n// Example 1:\n// >>> maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)\n// [-4, -3, 5]\n// Example 2:\n// >>> maximum([4, -4, 4], 2)\n// [4, 4]\n// Example 3:\n// >>> maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1)\n// [2]\n// Note:\n// 1.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given an array of integers and a positive integer k. We need to return a sorted array of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr. So, the output should be a sorted array containing the largest k elements from the input array.\n\nLet me look at the examples to understand better.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [-3, -4, 5], k=3\nOutput: [-4, -3, 5]\nWait, but the output is sorted. So, the maximum k numbers are -4, -3, 5, which are the three largest elements. So, the output is sorted in ascending order.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [4, -4, 4], k=2\nOutput: [4, 4]\nSo, the two largest elements are 4 and 4, which are the maximums.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k=1\nOutput: [2]\nSo, the largest element is 2.\n\nNote:\n1. The array length is between 1 and 1000.\n2. The elements are in the range [-1000, 1000].\n3. k is between 0 and len(arr).\n\nSo, the function needs to handle cases where k is 0, which would return an empty array. Also, if k is larger than the array length, we can only return the entire array sorted.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that k is a positive integer. Wait, no, looking back: \"a positive integer k\". So, k is at least 1. Wait, no, the note says 0 <= k <= len(arr). So, k can be 0. So, the function should handle k=0, which returns an empty array.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the first example has k=3, which is the length of the array. So, perhaps the function should return the top k elements, but if k is larger than the array length, then it returns the entire array sorted.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"length k\", so if k is larger than the array length, then the output is the entire array sorted, but only the top k elements. So, for example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], and k=5, then the output is [1,2,3,4], but sorted.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return a sorted array of length k. So, if k is larger than the array length, then the output is the entire array sorted. If k is zero, return empty array.\n\nSo, the first step is to handle the cases where k is zero or larger than the array length.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. If k is zero, return an empty array.\n2. Else, if k is larger than the array length, return the array sorted in ascending order.\n3. Else, take the top k elements from the array, sort them, and return them.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the array is [-3, -4, 5], and k=3. So, the top 3 elements are -4, -3, 5. So, the output is sorted in ascending order.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- If k is zero, return empty array.\n- Else, if k is larger than the array length, return the array sorted in ascending order.\n- Else, sort the array in ascending order, take the last k elements, then sort them again in ascending order, and return.\n\nWait, no. Because if we sort the array in ascending order, take the last k elements, which are the largest, and then sort them again in ascending order, that would be the same as the last k elements. So, perhaps it's better to"], ["//Given a non-empty array of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.\n// Examples\n// >>> solution([5, 8, 7, 1])\n// 12\n// >>> solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])\n// 9\n// >>> solution([30, 13, 24, 321])\n// 0\nfunction solution(lst){ ... }\n</think><think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the sum of all the odd elements that are in even positions of a given array. Hmm, let's think about what that means.\n\nWait, the array is zero-indexed, right? So the positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. So even positions would be 0, 2, 4, etc. But wait, the problem says \"even positions\" but in the examples, like the first one is [5,8,7,1]. The odd elements are 5 and 1. Wait, 5 is at position 0, which is even. 1 is at position 3, which is odd. So why is the sum 5+1=6? But the example says the sum is 12. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me look at the examples again. The first example is [5,8,7,1]. The output is 12. Let's see: the odd elements are 5,7,1. Now, their positions are 0,2,3. So the even positions are 0 and 2. So 5 and 7 are in even positions. So 5+7=12. Oh right, so the sum is 12. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the task is to iterate through the array, check each element: if it's odd, and if its position is even (0-based), then add it to the sum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize a sum variable to 0.\n2. Loop through each element in the array with its index.\n3. For each element, check if it's odd.\n4. If it is, check if the index is even (0, 2, 4, etc.).\n5. If both conditions are true, add the element to the sum.\n6. After processing all elements, return the sum.\n\nWait, but in the second example, [3,3,3,3,3], the output is 9. Let's see: the odd elements are all 3s. Their positions are 0,1,2,3,4. So even positions are 0,2,4. So 3+3+3=9. That's correct.\n\nThird example: [30,13,24,321]. The odd elements are 13 and 321. Their positions are 1 and 3, which are odd. So no elements are added, sum is 0.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nThe function is called solution and takes lst as parameter.\n\nSo, let's write the code.\n\nInitialize sum as 0.\n\nLoop through each element with index:\n\nfor (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {\n   if (lst[i] % 2 !== 0) { // check if odd\n      if (i % 2 === 0) { // even index\n          sum += lst[i];\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nReturn sum.\n\nWait, but wait: in the first example, the sum is 5+7=12. So the code would correctly add those.\n\nTesting the code with the examples:\n\nFirst example: [5,8,7,1]\n\ni=0: 5 is odd, index 0 is even. sum +=5 \u2192 sum=5.\n\ni=1: 8 is even, skip.\n\ni=2:7 is odd, index 2 is even. sum +=7 \u2192 sum=12.\n\ni=3:1 is odd, index 3 is odd. Skip.\n\nSo sum is 12. Correct.\n\nSecond example: [3,3,3,3,3]\n\ni=0:3 is odd, index 0 is even. sum=3.\n\ni=1:3 is odd, index 1 is odd. Skip.\n\ni=2:3 is odd, index 2 even. sum=6.\n\ni=3:3 is odd, index 3 odd. Skip.\n\ni=4:3 is odd, index 4 even. sum=9.\n\nSo sum is 9. Correct.\n\nThird example: [30,13,24,321]\n\ni=0:30 is even, skip.\n\ni="], ["//Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return\n// the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.\n// Example:\n// >>> add_elements([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4)\n// 24\n// Constraints:\n// 1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100\n// 2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)\nfunction add_elements(arr, k){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the sum of elements in the first k elements of an array that have at most two digits. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The array is given, and for the first k elements, I have to sum those elements which have at most two digits. So, for each element in the first k elements, I check if it has two or fewer digits. If yes, add it to the sum. Otherwise, ignore it.\n\nWait, but what's considered as having two or fewer digits? For example, 100 is three digits, so it's excluded. 10 is two digits, included. 5 is one digit, included. 0 is zero digits? Wait, but in the problem statement, the array is of integers. So, 0 is a single digit, so it's included.\n\nWait, but in the example given: [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and k=4. So the first four elements are 111, 21, 3, 4000. Let's see:\n\n111: three digits, so excluded.\n\n21: two digits, included.\n\n3: one digit, included.\n\n4000: four digits, excluded.\n\nSo the sum is 21 + 3 = 24, which matches the example.\n\nSo the task is to process the first k elements, check each for the number of digits, and sum those with two or fewer digits.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through the first k elements of the array.\n\n2. For each element, determine the number of digits it has.\n\n3. If the number of digits is <= 2, add it to the sum.\n\n4. Return the sum.\n\nNow, how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, I need to get the first k elements. So, arr.slice(0, k).\n\nThen, for each element in this slice, check the number of digits.\n\nHow to count the number of digits in a number? Well, for a number n, the number of digits is the floor of log10(n) + 1, but we have to handle n=0 correctly.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, numbers can be negative. Wait, but the problem says it's an array of integers. So, can the elements be negative? Because in the example, all elements are positive, but the problem statement doesn't specify. So, perhaps the function should handle negative numbers as well.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"elements with at most two digits\". So, for example, -123 is three digits, so it's excluded. 12 is two digits, included.\n\nSo, the function needs to handle negative numbers correctly.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each number in the first k elements:\n\n- If it's negative, take its absolute value to count the digits.\n\n- Then, count the digits.\n\nBut wait, what about zero? Zero is a single digit, so it's included.\n\nSo, the steps for each element:\n\n1. If the element is zero, add it to the sum.\n\n2. Else, take the absolute value of the element.\n\n3. Count the number of digits in this absolute value.\n\n4. If the count is <= 2, add the element to the sum.\n\nSo, how to count the digits.\n\nIn JavaScript, for a number n, the number of digits is:\n"], ["//Given a positive integer n, return a sorted array that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n// The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n// as follows: start with any positive integer n.

If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n// term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n// Note: \n// 1.

The array should be sorted in increasing order.\n\nHmm, let's think about the Collatz sequence. For a given n, the sequence is generated by repeatedly applying the Collatz rules: if the current number is even, divide by two; if it's odd, multiply by three and add one. We continue this until we reach 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to collect all the odd numbers in the sequence and return them in a sorted array. So, for example, when n is 5, the sequence is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. The odd numbers are 5 and 1, so the result is [1, 5].\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Generate the Collatz sequence starting from n.\n2. For each number in the sequence, check if it's odd.\n3. Collect all the odd numbers.\n4. Sort the collected odd numbers in increasing order.\n5. Return this sorted array.\n\nWait, but the example shows that for n=5, the output is [1,5], which is sorted. So, the function needs to return the odd numbers in the sequence, sorted.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a list to hold the odd numbers.\n- Start with the initial number n.\n- While the current number is not 1:\n   - If the current number is odd, add it to the list.\n   - Apply the Collatz rule: if even, divide by two; if odd, multiply by three and add one.\n   - Update the current number to the result.\n- After the loop, check if 1 is in the list. If not, add it.\n- Then, sort the list and return it.\n\nWait, but in the example, n=5, the sequence is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. So, the odd numbers are 5 and 1. So, the list is [5,1], which when sorted becomes [1,5].\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Generate the Collatz sequence.\n- For each number in the sequence, if it's odd, add it to the list.\n- Then, sort the list.\n\nBut wait, the initial number n could be even or odd. So, for example, if n is 6, the sequence is [6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. The odd numbers are 3,5,1. So, the list is [3,5,1], which when sorted becomes [1,3,5].\n\nSo, the function needs to collect all the odd numbers in the sequence, regardless of where they are, and then return them sorted.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Initialize a list to collect the odd numbers.\n2. Start with the initial number n.\n3. While the current number is not 1:\n   a. If current is odd, add to the list.\n   b. Apply the Collatz step.\n   c. Update current to the result.\n4. After the loop, check if 1 is in the list. If not, add it.\n5. Sort the list.\n6. Return the sorted list.\n\nWait, but in the case where the initial number is 1, the sequence is [1], so the list is [1], which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=1, returns [1].\n\nn=2: sequence is [2,1].

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the date string into its components: month, day, and year. The date string is in the format mm-dd-yyyy, so I can split it using the '-' delimiter. But I should also make sure that the string is correctly formatted, meaning that it has exactly two digits for the month and day, and four digits for the year. If the string doesn't match this format, it's invalid.\n\nSo, step one: check if the date string is in the correct format. If not, return false.\n\nNext, I need to extract the month, day, and year from the string. Let's say the date string is split into parts using the split('-') method. So, for example, \"03-11-2000\" becomes [\"03\", \"11\", \"2000\"]. Then, I can convert these parts into numbers: month = parseInt(parts[0], 10), day = parseInt(parts[1], 10), year = parseInt(parts[2], 10).\n\nOnce I have these values, I need to check the validity of each component.\n\nLet's look at the rules again:\n\n1. The date string is not empty. So, if the date string is empty, return false.\n\n2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me rephrase it:\n\n- For months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12 (which are the months with 31 days), the number of days must be between 1 and 31, inclusive.\n\n- For months 4,6,9,11 (which are the months with 30 days), the number of days must be between 1 and 30, inclusive.\n\n- For month 2 (February), the number of days must be between 1 and 29, inclusive. But wait, leap years can affect February's days. So, I need to account for that.\n\nSo, the steps for each month:\n\n- If the month is 1,3,5,7,8,10,12: days must be 1-31.\n\n- If the month is 4,6,9,11: days must be 1-30.\n\n- If the month is 2: days must be 1-29, but also considering leap years.\n\nSo, I need to calculate whether the year is a leap year to determine the number of days in February.\n\nHow do I calculate a leap year? The rules are:\n\n- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.\n\n- However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless...\n\n- The year is also divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- 2000 is a leap year because it's divisible by 4"], ["//Given a string of words, return an array of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you\n// should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the\n// alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25\n// Examples\n// >>> split_words(\"Hello world!\")\n// [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\n// >>> split_words(\"Hello,world!\")\n// [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\n// >>> split_words(\"abcdef\")\n// 3\nfunction split_words(txt){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function called split_words that takes a string of words and returns an array of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exist in the text you should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25.\n\nHmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the function is called split_words and takes a single argument txt.\n\nThe function needs to process this string and return an array of words under certain conditions.\n\nLet me look at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nsplit_words(\"Hello world!\") returns [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nSo, the string is split on whitespace, which is any sequence of non-whitespace characters. So, the function splits on any whitespace, like spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.\n\nExample 2:\nsplit_words(\"Hello,world!\") returns [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nWait, that's interesting. So, the comma is in the middle, but the function splits on whitespace, not commas. So, the function doesn't split on commas. So, the function only splits on whitespace, and if there are no whitespaces, it proceeds to the next condition.\n\nExample 3:\nsplit_words(\"abcdef\") returns 3\nSo, the string is \"abcdef\", which is a single word. The function returns the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet.\n\nWait, what's the process here?\n\nLet me think about the steps the function needs to take.\n\nFirst, check if the input string has any whitespace. If it does, split the string into words based on whitespace and return that array.\n\nIf there are no whitespaces, then check if there are any commas. If there are no commas, then count the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nWait, the function is supposed to return an array of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet.\n\nWait, so the function's logic is:\n\n- If the input string has any whitespace (like spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.), split into words and return that array.\n\n- If the input string has no whitespace, then check if it has any commas. If it has no commas, then compute the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says:\n\nIf no whitespaces exists in the text you should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let's see.\n\nSo, the problem is about two intervals, each represented by a pair of integers. Each interval is closed, meaning it includes both the start and end points.

Also, if the intersection is empty, return \"NO\".\n\nLet me think about how to find the intersection of two intervals.\n\nEach interval is a pair (start, end). The intersection is the set of points that are in both intervals.\n\nSo, for two intervals [a, b] and [c, d], the intersection is [max(a, c), min(b, d)].\n\nBut wait, only if max(a, c) <= min(b, d).

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given an array of integers, and we need to return the sum of the magnitudes of each integer multiplied by the product of all the signs of each number in the array. The signs are represented by 1, -1, or 0. Wait, but in the array, each element is either 1, -1, or 0. So, for each element in the array, we have a sign (1, -1, or 0), and we need to compute the product of all these signs.

Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs of each number in the array.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse the problem statement again.\n\nWe are to compute for each integer in the array, the product of all the signs (1, -1, 0) of each number. Then, for each integer, multiply it by this product, take the absolute value of that product, and sum all these absolute values.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says: sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs of each number in the array.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the product of all the signs of each number, and then multiply each integer by that product, take the absolute value, and sum all those.\n\nWait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the product of all the signs of each number in the array is a single value, and each integer is multiplied by this product, then the absolute value of each product is taken, and all these are summed.\n\nWait, that's possible.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input: [1, 2, 2, -4].\n\nEach element's sign is 1, 1, 1, -1. So the product of all signs is 1 * 1 * 1 * (-1) = -1.\n\nThen, for each element, multiply by this product: 1*(-1) = -1, 2*(-1) = -2, 2*(-1) = -2, -4*(-1) = 4. Then take the absolute value of each: 1, 2, 2, 4. Sum is 1+2+2+4=9, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each element in the array, determine its sign: 1 if positive, -1 if negative, 0 if zero.\n\n2. Compute the product of all these signs. Let's call this product P.\n\n3. For each element in the array, multiply it by P, take the absolute value of the result, and sum all these.\n\n4. If the array is empty, return undefined.\n\nSo, the function should:\n\n- Check if the array is empty. If yes, return undefined.\n\n- For each element in the array, compute its sign.\n\n- Compute the product of all these signs.\n\n- For each element, multiply it by the product, take absolute value, sum all.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, handle the empty array case: if arr is empty, return undefined.\n\nElse, for each element in arr, compute its sign.\n\nBut wait, what about zero? Because if any element is zero, then the product P will be zero. Because any number multiplied by zero is zero.\n\nSo, if any element is zero, then P is zero, and all elements multiplied by P will be zero, so the sum is zero.\n\nSo, in that case, the function can immediately return zero.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nFor example, in the second sample input: [0, 1].\n\nEach element's sign is 0 and 1.\n\nProduct P is 0 * 1 = 0.\n\nEach element multiplied by P is 0 * 0 = 0, 1 * 0 = 0. Sum is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, if any element is zero, the product is zero, so all terms are zero, sum is zero.\n\nSo, in code,"], ["//Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n// each cell of the grid contains a value.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe have an N x N grid, where each cell contains a unique integer from 1 to N^2. We need to find a path of length k (visiting exactly k cells) such that the sequence of values in the cells is lexicographically smallest possible. The path can move to any adjacent cell (sharing an edge), and we can start from any cell. The path must not go off the grid.\n\nThe output is an ordered array of the values in the order they appear in the path.\n\nConstraints:\n- N >= 2\n- k is a positive integer, but the problem says k is a positive integer, but in the examples, k can be 1, 3, etc.\n\nWait, the problem says k is a positive integer, but in the examples, k is 3 and 1. So, k can be as small as 1.\n\nBut the problem says that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells. So, for k=1, the path is just a single cell.\n\nThe goal is to find the lex smallest path of length k.\n\nLex order is determined by the first differing element. So, for example, [1,2,3] is lex smaller than [1,2,4], but [1,2,3] is larger than [1,3,3].\n\nSo, the approach is to find a path of exactly k cells, starting from any cell, moving to adjacent cells, such that the sequence of values is lex smallest possible.\n\nThe problem says that the answer is unique, so we don't have to worry about multiple paths with the same lex order.\n\nSo, how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible approaches.\n\nOne approach is to generate all possible paths of length k, compute their value sequences, and find the lex smallest one. But this is computationally infeasible for large N and k, as the number of possible paths is huge.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea is to model this as a graph problem, where each node represents a cell, and edges connect adjacent cells. Then, the problem reduces to finding a path of length k (i.e., visiting k nodes) such that the sequence of node values is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to find the lex smallest path of length k.\n\nWait, but the path can be any length, but the problem says exactly k cells. So, the path is a sequence of k cells, each adjacent to the next, and the sequence is lex smallest.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to finding the lex smallest subsequence of length k in a grid, but with the constraint that the subsequence must be a path (i.e., each consecutive element is adjacent in the grid).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea is to use dynamic programming.

Well, one way is to convert the number into a string, then iterate over each character, convert it back to a number, and check if it's odd.\n\nAlternatively, I can use modulo 10 to get each digit. But for a number, it's easier to convert it to a string and process each character.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Convert the number n into a string to easily access each digit.\n2.

Otherwise, return the product.\n\nWait, but in the example, digits(235) returns 15. Let's see: 2 is even, 3 is odd, 5 is odd. So product is 3 *5 =15. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: digits(4) returns 0 because 4 is even.\n\nAnother example: digits(0) would return 0, since 0 is even.\n\nWait, but what about digits(20)? 2 is even, 0 is even. So product is 0.\n\nBut what about digits(10)? 1 is odd, 0 is even. So product is 1.\n\nSo, the function should return the product of all odd digits, but if all digits are even, return 0.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Convert n to a string.\n- For each character in the string:\n   - Convert to number.\n   - Check if it's odd.\n   - If it's odd, multiply to the product.\n- After processing all digits, if the product is zero (which can happen if any digit was odd, but wait, no: if all digits are even, the product is zero. So, after processing, if the product is zero, return zero. Otherwise, return the product.\n\nWait, no. Because if any digit is odd, the product is non-zero.

Or is it that each element is rounded up, and then squared? Or is it that each element is rounded up, and then squared?\n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the examples.\n\nIn the first example: lst([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) returns 14. Let's compute:\n\nEach element is 1.0, 2.0, 3.0. Rounding each to ceiling: 1, 2, 3. Squared: 1,4,9. Sum is 14.

Correct.\n\nFifth example: [-2.4,1.0,1.0] \u2192 ceiling of -2.4 is -2 (since ceiling of a negative number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to it). So, -2, 1,1. Squared: 4,1,1 \u2192 sum 6. Correct.\n\nSo, the process is: for each element in the array, round it up to the ceiling, then square it, then sum all those squares.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1.

Square each of these ceiling values.\n\n4. Sum all these squared ceiling values.\n\nSo, the function needs to perform these steps.\n\nNow, how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, the function is called sum_squares and takes a parameter lst.\n\nWe need to process each element in lst.\n\nFor each element, we can use Math.ceil() function, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number.\n\nWait, but wait: for negative numbers, Math.ceil() works as expected. For example, Math.ceil(-2.4) is -2, which is correct.\n\nSo, for each element, we can compute Math.ceil(element), then square it.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nInitialize a sum variable to 0.\n\nLoop through each element in lst:\n\nsum += (Math.ceil(element)) ** 2;\n\nAfter processing all elements, return sum.\n\nWait, but wait:"], ["//Create a function that returns true if the last character\n// of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not\n// a part of a word, and false otherwise.\n// Note: \"word\" is a group of characters separated by space.\n// Examples:\n// >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pie\")\n// false\n// >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e\")\n// true\n// >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e \")\n// false\n// >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"\")\n// false\nfunction check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt){ ...}\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called check_if_last_char_is_a_letter that returns true if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find the last character of the string. That's easy, using the lastIndexOf method or just accessing the last character with [txt.length - 1].\n\nNext, I need to determine if that last character is an alphabetical character. So, I can check if it's between 'a' and 'z' or between 'A' and 'Z'. But wait, the note says that \"word\" is a group of characters separated by space. So, the last character being part of a word would mean that it's the last character of a word, which is a group separated by spaces.\n\nWait, no. The note says that \"word\" is a group of characters separated by space. So, the last character of a word is the last character of a group separated by space. So, if the last character is part of a word, then it's the last character of a word, and thus, the last character is part of a word. So, in that case, the function should return false because the last character is part of a word.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return true if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. So, if the last character is part of a word, regardless of whether it's a letter, the function should return false.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe function should return true if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. So, the last character must be a letter, and it must not be part of a word.\n\nWait, but the note says that \"word\" is a group of characters separated by space. So, the last character is part of a word if it's the last character of a word, which is a group separated by space.\n\nSo, for example, in the string \"apple pie\", the last character is 'e' (from 'pie'), which is part of a word. So, the function should return false.\n\nIn the string \"apple pi e\", the last character is 'e', which is part of a word (the last word is 'e'), so the function should return true.\n\nIn the string \"apple pi e \", the last character is ' ', which is not a letter, so function returns false.\n\nIn the empty string, the last character is undefined, so function returns false.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Check if the string is empty. If it is, return false.\n\n2. Get the last character of the string.\n\n3. Check if the last character is a letter (a-z or A-Z).\n\n4. Check if the last character is not part of a word. How to determine that?\n\nWait, how to determine if the last character is part of a word. A word is a group of characters separated by space. So, the last character is part of a word if it is the last character of a word, which is a group of characters separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for example, in \"apple pie\", the last character is 'e' which is part of the word 'pie'.\n\nIn \"apple pi e\", the last character is 'e' which is part of the word 'e'.\n\nIn \"apple pi e \", the last character is ' ', which is not part of any word.\n\nSo, how to determine if the last character is part of a word.\n\nWait, perhaps the last character is part of a word if it is the last character of a word. So, a word is a sequence of characters separated by spaces. So, the last character of a word is the last character of the string, but only if it's not part of a longer word.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: if the last character is the last character of a word, then it's part of a word. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, how to check if the last character is part of a word.\n\nAn alternative approach is to split the string into words and check if the last character is the last character of any word.\n\nWait, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last character"], ["//Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which\n// is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.

If there are no negatives or positives, return undefined for both.\n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input array and separate the negative integers, positive integers, and zero. Because zero is neither positive nor negative, it won't contribute to either a or b.\n\nSo, for each element in the array, I can check if it's negative, positive, or zero.\n\nI'll need to collect all the negative integers into a list called negatives and all the positive integers into a list called positives.\n\nOnce I have these two lists, I can determine if they are non-empty.\n\nIf negatives is empty, then a is undefined. Similarly, if positives is empty, then b is undefined.\n\nOtherwise, a is the maximum of negatives, and b is the minimum of positives.\n\nWait, but what about zero? Because zero is neither positive nor negative. So, if the array has zero, it doesn't affect the negatives or positives lists.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input [2,4,1,3,5,7], all are positive. So negatives is empty, so a is undefined. Positives has 2,4,1,3,5,7. The smallest is 1, so b is 1. So the output is [undefined, 1].\n\nAnother example: [0]. The negatives list is empty, positives list is empty. So both a and b are undefined.\n\nAnother example: [2,4,1,3,5,7]. As before.\n\nAnother test case: [ -1, -2, -3, 4, 5]. So negatives are [-1, -2, -3], the largest is -1. Positives are [4,5], the smallest is 4. So output is [-1,4].\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return an array where a is the largest of the negatives, and b is the smallest of the positives. So in this case, a is -1, b is 4.\n\nSo the function should return [-1,4].\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n\n2. For each element, check if it is negative, positive, or zero.\n\n3. Collect all negative integers into a list called negatives.\n\n4. Collect all positive integers into a list called positives.\n\n5. If negatives is empty, a is undefined. Else, a is the maximum of negatives.\n\n6. If positives is empty, b is undefined. Else, b is the minimum of positives.\n\n7. Return [a, b].\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, I'll create two variables: negatives and positives.\n\nInitialize them as empty arrays.\n\nThen, loop through each element in the input list.\n\nFor each element:\n\n- if element < 0: add to negatives.\n\n- else if element > 0: add to positives.\n\n- else: do nothing.\n\nAfter processing all elements, check if negatives is empty. If so, a is undefined. Else, a is Math.max(...negatives).\n\nSimilarly, check if positives is empty. If so, b is undefined. Else, b is Math.min(...positives).\n\nThen, return [a, b].\n\nWait, but what about the case where the array is empty? Then, both negatives and positives are empty, so a and b are undefined.\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nNow, let's think about some test cases.\n\nTest case 1: [2,4,1,3,5,7]\n\nnegatives is empty, positives is [2,4,1,3,5,7]. So a is undefined, b is 1. So output is [undefined, 1].\n\nTest case 2: [0]\n\nnegatives is empty, positives is empty. So output is [undefined, undefined].\n\nTest case 3: [-1, -2, -3, 4, 5]\n\nnegatives is [-1, -2, -3], so a is -1.\n\npositives is ["], ["//Create a function that takes integers, floats, or strings representing\n// real numbers, and returns the larger variable in its given variable type.\n// Return undefined if the values are equal.\n// Note: If a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,\n// >>> compare_one(1, 2.5)\n// 2.5\n// >>> compare_one(1, \"2,3\")\n// \"2,3\"\n// >>> compare_one(\"5,1\", \"6\")\n// \"6\"\n// >>> compare_one(\"1\", 1)\n// undefined\nfunction compare_one(a, b){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a function called compare_one that takes two arguments, a and b. These can be integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers. The function should return the larger of the two, but only if they are of different types. If they are of the same type, it returns undefined. Wait, no, the note says if the values are equal, return undefined. So, for example, if a is 1 and b is 1, return undefined. But if a is 1 and b is 2.5, return 2.5. If a is \"2,3\" and b is 2.5, return \"2,3\" because it's a string and 2.5 is a float. If a is \"5,1\" and b is \"6\", return \"6\" because it's the larger string. If a is \"1\" and b is \"2\", return \"2\".\n\nSo, the function needs to compare the two values and determine which is larger. But the comparison is not straightforward because the types of a and b can be different. So, the function needs to first check if a and b are of the same type. If they are, then compare their values numerically. If they are different types, then compare their string representations, but only if they are numeric strings. Wait, but how do I determine if a string is a numeric string?\n\nHmm, perhaps the function can first check if a and b are both numbers (int or float), or both are strings that represent numbers. Then, compare them accordingly. Otherwise, return undefined.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return the larger variable. So, for example, if a is 1 and b is \"2\", then 1 is a number and \"2\" is a string. So, the function should compare them as numbers and strings. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the function should first check if a and b are both numbers (int or float) or both are strings that can be converted to numbers. Then, compare them numerically. Otherwise, compare them as strings.\n\nBut wait, the note says that if a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,.

So, perhaps the function should treat such strings as non-numeric and compare them as strings.\n\nWait, but in the example given, compare_one(\"5,1\", \"6\") returns \"6\" because \"6\" is larger than \"5,1\". So, the function compares the string representations lexicographically, not numerically.\n\nSo, the function needs to handle both numeric and string representations. So, the approach is:\n\n1. Check if a and b are both numbers (int or float) or both are strings that can be converted to numbers. If they are, compare their numeric values. Otherwise, compare their string representations.\n\nWait, but how to determine if a string is a numeric string? For example, \"123\" is numeric, \"12a\" is not. So, perhaps the function can try to parse the string as a number, and if it's possible, treat it as a numeric type. Otherwise, treat it as a string.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the function can first check if a and b are both numbers (int or float) or both are strings that can be converted to numbers. If they are, then compare their numeric values. Otherwise, compare their string representations.\n\nWait, but in the example, compare_one(\"5,1\", \"6\") returns \"6\" because \"6\" is larger than \"5,1\". So, the function compares the string representations lexicographically, not numerically. So, the function should compare the string representations as strings, not as numeric values.\n\nSo, the function's logic is:\n\n- If a and b are both numbers (int or float) or both are strings that can be converted to numbers, then compare their numeric values.

Each of these numbers must be an even number greater than 0.\n\n2. **Formulate the Equation**: Let the four even numbers be \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\).

Wait, the problem says the Brazilian factorial is defined as n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!. So for n=4, it's 4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288.\n\nSo the function needs to compute the product of the factorials of all integers from 1 up to n.\n\nSo, for example, special_factorial(4) returns 288.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each integer i from 1 to n, compute i! and multiply all these together.\n\nBut wait, computing factorials for each i and then multiplying them could be computationally intensive for large n, but given that the problem doesn't specify constraints on n, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFirst, for each i in 1 to n, compute i! and multiply it into the result.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize a result variable as 1.\n\n2. For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. Compute i! (i factorial).\n\n   b. Multiply the result by this i!.\n\n3. Return the result.\n\nSo, the key is to compute i! for each i and multiply it into the result.\n\nBut computing i! for each i can be done iteratively.\n\nWait, for i=1, 1! is 1.\n\nFor i=2, 2! is 2.\n\nFor i=3, 3! is 6.\n\nSo, the product is 1 * 2 * 6 = 12.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says the special factorial is the product of all factorials from 1! to n!.\n\nSo, for n=4, it's 1! * 2! * 3! * 4! = 1 * 2 * 6 * 24 = 288.\n\nSo, the function needs to compute the product of 1! * 2! * ... * n!.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize result as 1.\n\n- For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   - Compute i! (i factorial).\n\n   - Multiply result by i!.\n\n- Return result.\n\nBut computing i! for each i can be done iteratively as well.\n\nWait, for i=1, 1! is 1.\n\nFor i=2, 2! is 2.\n\nFor i=3, 3! is 6.\n\nSo, the product is 1 * 2 * 6 = 12.\n\nWait, but 1! * 2! * 3! = 1 * 2 * 6 = 12.\n\nSo, for n=3, special_factorial(3) is 12.\n\nSo, the function needs to compute this.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\ndef special_factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        result *= math.factorial(i)\n    return result\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says that the function will receive an integer as input and should return the special factorial of this integer.\n\nSo, the code needs to import math, but perhaps the function can compute the factorials without using math.factorial.\n\nBut for the sake of simplicity, perhaps using math.factorial is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what about n=0? The problem says n>0, so n is at least 1.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nImport math.\n\nInitialize result as 1.\n\nLoop i from 1 to n inclusive.\n\nMultiply result by math.factorial(i).\n\nReturn result.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef special_factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        result *= math.factorial(i)\n    return result\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input: special_factorial(4) should return 288.\n\nLet's compute:\n\ni=1: 1! =1. result=1*1=1.\n\ni=2: 2! =2. result=1*2="], ["//Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, \n// and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, \n// then replace all consecutive spaces with - \n// >>> fix_spaces(\" Example\")\n// \"Example\"\n// >>> fix_spaces(\" Example 1\")\n// \"Example_1\"\n// >>> fix_spaces(\" Example 2\")\n// \"_Example_2\"\n// >>> fix_spaces(\" Example 3\")\n// \"_Example-3\"\nfunction fix_spaces(text){}\n\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called fix_spaces that takes a string and replaces all spaces with underscores. But if there are more than two consecutive spaces, they should be replaced with hyphens. Otherwise, just underscores.\n\nHmm, so the function needs to process the string and look for sequences of spaces. For each sequence, determine how many spaces there are and replace them with the appropriate character.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can loop through each character in the string and keep track of the current space sequence. When I encounter a space, I start counting. If the count exceeds two, I replace the sequence with hyphens. Otherwise, I replace with underscores.\n\nAlternatively, I can split the string into an array of words, but that might not be straightforward because words can be separated by multiple spaces. So perhaps using a regular expression would be more efficient.\n\nYes, regular expressions can help here. I can write a regex that matches sequences of one or more spaces and then replace them with the appropriate characters.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Use a regular expression to find all sequences of one or more spaces.\n2. For each sequence, determine the length:\n   - If the length is 1, replace with '_'.\n   - If the length is 2, replace with '_'.\n   - If the length is 3 or more, replace with '-'.\n3. Replace all such sequences in the original string.\n\nWait, but the problem says that if a string has more than two consecutive spaces, replace all consecutive spaces with '-'. So, for example, three spaces become '-', four spaces become '-', etc.\n\nSo, the regex can capture sequences of one or more spaces, and then in the replacement, we can use a ternary operator or a function to decide which character to use.\n\nIn JavaScript, I can use the replace method with a regular expression and a function as the replacement. So, for each match, the function will return the appropriate character.\n\nSo, the regex pattern would be / +/g, which matches one or more spaces. But wait, in JavaScript, the space is a regular character, so the regex / +/g will match one or more spaces.\n\nWait, no. The space is a regular character, so the regex / +/g will match one or more spaces.

So, I can split the string into parts before and after the dot and check the count of digits in the part before the dot.\n\nWait, but the dot is only one, so the part before is everything before the first dot, and the part after is everything after the first dot.\n\nSo, for example, in \"example.txt\", the before is \"example\", which has 6 letters, but the condition is that there should be no more than three digits. So, in this case, the before part has no digits, so it's okay.\n\nSo, for the before part, I need to count the number of digits. If it's more than three, the name is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, for the after part, it should consist of exactly one of the allowed strings: 'txt', 'exe', 'dll'.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1.

Check that the total number of digits in the entire string is at most three.\n\nWait, but the before_dot and after_dot are parts of the string, so the digits can only be in the before_dot or after_dot parts, not in the entire string.\n\nSo, for the entire string, the count of digits should be <=3.\n\nSo, perhaps, the approach is:\n\n- Split the string into before_dot and after_dot.\n\n- Check that there is exactly one dot.\n\n- Check that before_dot is not empty and starts with a letter.\n\n- Check that after_dot is one of the allowed strings.\n\n- Check that the total number of digits in the entire string is <=3.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement each of these.\n\nFirst, checking for exactly one dot:\n\nWe can use the split method with the dot as the separator. So, file_name.split('.') should give an array with exactly two elements. If it's not, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, if (file_name.split('.').length !== 2) return 'No'.\n\nThen, for the before_dot and after_dot:\n\nbefore_dot = file_name.split('.')[0]\n\nafter_dot = file_name.split('.')[1]\n\nWe need to check that before_dot is not empty and starts with a letter.\n\nSo, before_dot.length > 0 and before_dot[0] is a letter (a-z, A-Z).\n\nAlso, before_dot should not contain any digits.\n\nSimilarly, after_dot should be exactly one of ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].\n\nSo, after_dot must be in that array.\n\nAlso, the total number of digits in the entire string must be <=3.\n\nSo, how to count the number of digits in the entire string.\n\nWe can use a regular expression to find all the digits in the string and then check the count.\n\nSo, let's create a regex that matches all digits in the string.\n\nconst digits = file_name.match(/\\d+/g);\n\nif"], ["//\"\n// This function will take an array of integers.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to take a sentence, which is a string of words separated by spaces, and return a new string. The new string should contain only the words whose lengths are prime numbers. The order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original sentence.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, I need to split the sentence into individual words. Then, for each word, check if its length is a prime number. If it is, include it in the result. Finally, join these words back into a single string separated by spaces.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Split the sentence into words. In JavaScript, I can use the split() method, which by default splits on whitespace. So, sentence.split(' ') should give me an array of words.\n\n2. Iterate over each word in this array. For each word, calculate its length. Then, check if the length is a prime number.\n\n3. Collect all the words whose lengths are prime numbers.\n\n4. Join these collected words into a single string with spaces separating them.\n\nSo, the main challenges here are:\n\n- How to check if a number is a prime. I need a helper function for that.\n\n- Handling edge cases, like empty strings or words with zero length. But since the input is a sentence, each word is at least one character, so no problem there.\n\nLet me think about the helper function for checking primes. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, for a number n, if any number from 2 to sqrt(n) divides it, it's not prime.\n\nWait, but for n=1, it's not a prime. So, in the helper function, I should return false for n <= 1.\n\nSo, the helper function could look like this:\n"], ["//Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression\n// x * n. The function returns true if x * n evaluates to a whole number and false\n// otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,\n// <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.\n// You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.\n// >>> simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\")\n// true\n// >>> simplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\")\n// false\n// >>> simplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\")\n// false\nfunction simplify(x, n){ ... }\nOkay, I need to implement a function called simplify that takes two arguments, x and n. Both are string representations of fractions, like \"numerator/denominator\". The function should return true if x multiplied by n results in a whole number, and false otherwise.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to parse both x and n into their respective fractions. Let's think about how to do that. For example, if x is \"1/5\", then the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 5. Similarly for n.\n\nOnce I have the numerators and denominators for both x and n, I can perform the multiplication. So x * n would be (x_num * n_num) / (x_den * n_den). For this to be a whole number, the product of the numerators must be divisible by the product of the denominators.\n\nWait, but that's not the only condition. Because even if the product is divisible, the resulting fraction might not be in its simplest form. So perhaps I should simplify the resulting fraction after multiplication.\n\nWait, but the problem says that x and n are valid fractions, so their product is a fraction. So I need to check if the product of the numerators is divisible by the product of the denominators.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the example given:\n\nExample 1:\nsimplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\") should return true.\nBecause 1/5 * 5/1 = (1*5)/(5*1) = 5/5 = 1, which is a whole number.\n\nExample 2:\nsimplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\") should return false.\nBecause 1/6 * 2/1 = 2/6 = 1/3, which is not a whole number.\n\nExample 3:\nsimplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\") should return false.\nBecause 7/10 * 10/2 = 70/20 = 7/2, which is 3.5, not a whole number.\n\nSo the function needs to compute the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators, then check if the numerator is divisible by the denominator.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a more efficient way. Because if I can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator after multiplication, I can simplify the fraction and then check if the denominator is 1.\n\nYes, that's a better approach. Because if the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators have a common divisor, we can divide both by that divisor to simplify the fraction. Then, if the simplified denominator is 1, the result is a whole number.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Parse x into numerator_x and denominator_x.\n2. Parse n into numerator_n and denominator_n.\n3. Compute the product of the numerators: product_num = numerator_x * numerator_n.\n4. Compute the product of the denominators: product_den = denominator_x * denominator_n.\n5. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of product_num and product_den.\n6. Divide both product_num and product_den by their GCD.\n7. Check if the resulting product_den is 1. If yes, return true; else, return false.\n\nWait, but what if the product_den is zero? But the problem states that both x and n are valid fractions with non-zero denominators, so product_den can't be zero.\n\nSo, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, I need to write a function to parse a string like \"numerator/denominator\" into numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, for example, given x = \"1/5\", I can split on '/' to get the numerator and denominator.\n\nIn JavaScript, I can do:\n"], ["//Write a function which sorts the given array of integers\n// in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n// Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n// order them based on their index in original array.\n// For example:\n// >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])\n// [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n// >>> order_by_points([])\n// []\nfunction order_by_points(nums){ ...}\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called order_by_points that takes an array of integers and sorts them in ascending order based on the sum of their digits. If two numbers have the same sum of digits, they should be ordered by their original index in the array. So, the function should return a new array where each element is sorted according to these criteria.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. First, I need to calculate the sum of the digits for each number in the array. Then, I can sort the array based on these sums, and if two sums are equal, their original indices determine the order.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each element in the input array, compute the sum of its digits.\n2. Create an array of objects or tuples that contain the original index, the sum of digits, and the number itself.\n3. Sort this new array based on the sum of digits first, and then the original index.\n4. Extract the numbers from the sorted array to form the result.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, how do I sort an array of objects? I can use the sort function, and for each pair, compare their sums. If the sums are equal, then compare their original indices.\n\nAlternatively, I can create an array where each element is an object with properties: index, sumDigits, and the number. Then, sort this array based on sumDigits and then index.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for each element in nums, I can create an object like { index: i, sumDigits: sumDigits, num: num }, where i is the index of the element in nums.\n\nThen, when I sort this array, I can first compare the sumDigits. If they are equal, then compare the index. That way, the elements are sorted by sum of digits, and then by their original position.\n\nOnce I have this sorted array, I can extract the numbers in order to form the result.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Create an array of objects with index, sum of digits, and the number.\n- Sort this array based on sum of digits, then index.\n- Extract the numbers from the sorted array.\n\nNow, how to compute the sum of digits for a number. Let's think about writing a helper function.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, numbers can be negative. So, for a number like -12, the digits are 1 and 2, sum is 3. So, the helper function should take the absolute value of the number to handle negative numbers correctly.\n\nSo, the helper function sumDigits(num) would be:\n"], ["//Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns \n// the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both \n// first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n// For example:\n// >>> specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15])\n// 1\n// >>> specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109])\n// 2\nfunction specialFilter(nums){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called specialFilter that takes an array of numbers and returns the count of elements that meet certain conditions. Let me think about what those conditions are.\n\nThe function needs to count elements that are greater than 10 and have both their first and last digits as odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Also, the number itself must be greater than 10. So, for each number in the array, I have to check these three things: is the number greater than 10? Does the first digit of the number is odd? Does the last digit of the number is odd?\n\nWait, but wait. The number could be negative, like -73. So, the first digit is the absolute value of the number, right? Because the negative sign doesn't affect the digits. So, for -73, the first digit is 7, which is odd, and the last digit is 3, which is also odd. So, that would count as a valid number.\n\nSo, the steps for each number in the array are:\n\n1. Check if the number is greater than 10. If not, skip it.\n2. Convert the number to its absolute value to handle negative numbers.\n3. Check if the first digit is odd.\n4. Check if the last digit is odd.\n5. If both are true, increment the count.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I'll initialize a count variable to 0.\n\nThen, loop through each number in the input array.\n\nFor each number:\n\n- Check if the number is greater than 10. If not, continue to the next number.\n- Convert the number to its absolute value because negative numbers have the same digits as their positive counterparts.\n- Extract the first digit and the last digit.\n- Check if both are odd.\n\nHow to extract the first and last digits?\n\nFor the first digit, I can convert the number to a string, take the first character, and convert it back to a number.\n\nFor the last digit, I can take the last character of the string representation and convert it to a number.\n\nSo, for example, number = 15:\n\n- String is \"15\"\n- First digit is \"1\" \u2192 1, which is odd.\n- Last digit is \"5\" \u2192 5, which is odd.\nSo, it counts.\n\nAnother example: number = -73.\n\n- String is \"-73\"\n- Absolute value is 73.\n- First digit is \"7\" \u2192 7, odd.\n- Last digit is \"3\" \u2192 3, odd.\nSo, it counts.\n\nAnother example: number = 21.\n\n- String is \"21\"\n- First digit is \"2\" \u2192 2, even. So, it doesn't count.\n\nAnother example: number = 109.\n\n- String is \"109\"\n- First digit is \"1\" \u2192 1, odd.\n- Last digit is \"9\" \u2192 9, odd.\nSo, it counts.\n\nSo, the steps for each number are:\n\n1. If num <= 10, skip.\n2. Convert num to absolute value as string.\n3. Check first digit is odd.\n4. Check last digit is odd.\n5. If both, increment count.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFunction specialFilter(nums) {\n\n    let count = 0;\n\n    for (let num of nums) {\n\n        if (num <= 10) continue;\n\n        let str = Math.abs(num).toString();\n\n        let first = parseInt(str[0], 10);\n\n        let last = parseInt(str[str.length - 1], 10);\n\n        if (first % 2 !== 0 && last % 2 !== 0) {\n\n            count++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return count;\n\n}\n\nWait, but what about numbers like 0? Well, 0 is not greater than 10, so it's skipped.\n\nWhat about numbers like 10? 10 is not greater than 10, so it's skipped.\n\nWhat about numbers like 11? 11 is greater than 10. First digit is 1, last is 1. Both are odd. So, it"], ["//You are given a positive integer n.

The array a is constructed such that each element a[i] = i\u00b2 - i + 1. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the array a. Let's compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern. For i=1: 1\u00b2 -1 +1 =1. For i=2: 4-2+1=3. i=3:9-3+1=7. i=4:16-4+1=13. i=5:25-5+1=21. So the array starts as [1,3,7,13,21,...]. \n\nNow, the key is to find triples where the sum is divisible by 3. Since we're dealing with modulo 3, it might be easier to compute each a[i] modulo 3 and then find triples where the sum of their mod 3 values is 0.\n\nLet me compute a[i] mod 3 for the first few terms:\n\ni=1: 1 mod 3 =1\ni=2:3 mod3=0\ni=3:7 mod3=1 (since 7-6=1)\ni=4:13 mod3=1 (13-12=1)\ni=5:21 mod3=0 (21 is divisible by 3)\ni=6:36-6+1=31 mod3=1 (31-30=1)\ni=7:49-7+1=43 mod3=1 (43-42=1)\ni=8:64-8+1=57 mod3=0 (57 is divisible by 3)\ni=9:81-9+1=73 mod3=1 (73-72=1)\ni=10:100-10+1=91 mod3=1 (91-90=1)\n\nHmm, I notice a pattern here. For i=2,4,5,8,10, etc., the a[i] mod3 is 0. For i=1,3,6,7,9, etc., it's 1. And for i=4,5,8,9, etc., it's also 1. Wait, maybe I should list out more terms to see if there's a consistent pattern.\n\nLet me compute a few more:\n\ni=6:31 mod3=1\ni=7:43 mod3=1\ni=8:57 mod3=0\ni=9:73 mod3=1\ni=10:91 mod3=1\ni=11:121-11+1=111 mod3=0\ni=12:144-12+1=133 mod3=1\ni=13:169-13+1=157 mod3=1\ni=14:196-14+1=183 mod3=0\ni=15:225-15+1=211 mod3=2 (since 211-210=1, but 211 mod3 is 2)\n\nWait, so for i=14, a[i] mod3 is 0. So the pattern seems to be that for i=2,4,5,8,10,11,14, etc., a[i] mod3 is 0. For i=1,3,6,7,9,12,13, etc., it's 1.

The order from closest to farthest is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n\nSo, I can create an array in the order of the planets.

So the array should be:\n\n[\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the first step is to validate the input.

No, wait, no. Wait, the example says:\n\nbf(\"Jupiter\", \"Neptune\") returns [\"Saturn\", \"Uranus\"]\n\nWait, but according to the planetOrder array, the order is:\n\nMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n\nSo, Jupiter is index4, Neptune is index7.\n\nSo, the planets between are index5 (Saturn) and index6 (Uranus).

So, if planet1 is Jupiter (index4) and planet2 is Neptune (index7), the planets between are Mars (index3), which is not between 4 and 7. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, the problem says \"orbits located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2\".

Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the function needs to delete the strings that have odd lengths. So, for each string in the input array, I need to check if its length is odd. If it is, I remove it from the array. Then, I need to sort the resulting array based on two criteria: first, the length of each string in ascending order, and if two strings have the same length, then sort them alphabetically.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the array may contain duplicates, but the order of the array should be ascending by length of each word. So, for example, if the input is [\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"], the output after removing the odd-length strings is [\"aa\", \"a\"], because \"aaa\" has length 3, which is odd, so it's removed. Then, the sorted array is [\"aa\", \"a\"], but wait, \"a\" has length 1, which is odd, so it's removed. Wait, no, in the first example, the input is [\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"], so the lengths are 2, 1, 3. So the odd-length strings are \"a\" and \"aaa\", so they are removed. The remaining string is \"aa\", which has length 2. So the output is [\"aa\"], which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]. The lengths are 2, 1, 3, 2. So the odd-length strings are \"a\" and \"aaa\", so they are removed. The remaining strings are \"ab\" (length 2), \"a\" is removed, \"aaa\" is removed, and \"cd\" (length 2). So the remaining array is [\"ab\", \"cd\"]. Now, we need to sort this array. Since both have the same length, we sort them alphabetically. \"ab\" comes before \"cd\", so the output is [\"ab\", \"cd\"], which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Filter the input array to remove strings with odd lengths.\n2. Sort the resulting array based on the length of each string in ascending order.\n3. If two strings have the same length, sort them alphabetically.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the array may contain duplicates, but the order of the array should be ascending by length of each word. So, the filtering is done first, and then the sorting is done on the filtered array.\n\nSo, the function should:\n\n- Iterate through each string in the input array.\n- For each string, check if its length is odd. If it is, remove it from the array.\n- Then, sort the remaining array based on the length of each string in ascending order. If two strings have the same length, sort them alphabetically.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the function may assume that all words have the same length. So, perhaps the filtering can be done first, and then the sorting can be done based on the length, which is the same for all elements.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the array is always an array of strings and never an array of numbers. So, all elements are strings. So, the function can proceed under the assumption that all strings have the same length, but perhaps not. Wait, no, the problem says that the array may contain duplicates, but the order of the array should be ascending by length of each word. So, perhaps the function should sort the filtered array based on the length of each string, regardless of whether all strings have the same length or not.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the function may assume that all words have the same length. So, perhaps the function can proceed under that assumption, but I'm not sure. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe function should return an array of strings in sorted order. It may contain duplicates. The order is ascending by length"], ["//A simple program which should return the value of x if n is \n// a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.\n// Examples:\n// >>> x_or_y(7, 34, 12)\n// 34\n// >>> x_or_y(15, 8, 5)\n// 5\nfunction x_or_y(n, x, y){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called x_or_y that takes three arguments: n, x, and y. The function should return x if n is a prime number, and y otherwise. So, the first thing I need to do is determine whether n is a prime number. If it is, return x; else, return y.\n\nWait, but what about the examples given? Let me check. The first example is x_or_y(7, 34, 12). Since 7 is a prime, it returns 34. The second example is x_or_y(15, 8, 5). Since 15 is not a prime, it returns 5. So, the function correctly returns x or y based on the primality of n.\n\nSo, the core of the problem is to write a primality test function. How do I do that in Python?\n\nI remember that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, for a given n, I need to check if there's any integer between 2 and sqrt(n) that divides n evenly.\n\nWait, but what about n being less than 2? For example, n=1 or n=0. Those are not primes. So, in the function, I should first handle these edge cases.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. If n is less than 2, return y.\n2. Else, check if n is a prime.\n   a.

Return x if it's a prime, else return y.\n\nSo, the function x_or_y will first check if n is less than 2. If yes, return y. Else, perform the primality test.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing the primality test.\n\nLet's write a helper function is_prime(n) that returns True if n is prime, else False.\n\nBut wait, in Python, functions can be nested, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's better to implement the primality test directly within x_or_y.\n\nSo, in x_or_y(n, x, y):\n\n- If n < 2: return y\n- Else, check if n is prime:\n   - For i in range 2 to sqrt(n) + 1:\n      - if i divides n, return False\n   - If no divisors found, return True\n- Then, return x if it's prime, else y.\n\nWait, but how to compute the square root in Python? Using math.sqrt(n), but since n is an integer, we can cast it to an integer.\n\nWait, but for n=4, sqrt(4) is 2. So, in the loop, we need to check up to and including sqrt(n). So, the loop should run from 2 to int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1.\n\nWait, but in Python, the range is exclusive of the end. So, to include sqrt(n), we can use range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1).\n\nBut wait, what about when n is a perfect square? For example, n=9. sqrt(9) is 3. So, the loop should run up to 3, inclusive. So, the range should be 2 to 4 (since range is exclusive). So, in code, it's range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1).\n\nWait, let me test this.\n\nFor n=4: sqrt is 2. So, range(2, 2+1) is 2 to 3, which is just 2. So, i=2, which divides 4, so it's not a prime.\n\nFor n=9: sqrt is 3. So, range(2, 3+1) is 2 to 4, which is 2 and 3. So, i=2 and 3. 9 is divisible by 3, so not a prime.\n\nFor n=5: sqrt is ~2.236, so int is 2. So, range(2, 2+1) is 2 to 3, which is 2. 5 is not divisible by 2, so it's a prime.\n\nSo, the helper function is_prime(n"], ["//Given an array of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers\n// in the array that are odd.

Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe have two arrays, game and guess, of equal length. Each index represents a match. We need to determine how far off each guess was compared to the corresponding game's result. If the guess is correct, the value is 0. Otherwise, it's the absolute difference between the guess and the score.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the game is an array of scores, and the guess is an array of guesses. So for each index i, game[i] is the score of that match, and guess[i] is the guess for that match. We need to compare guess[i] with game[i], and compute the absolute difference if it's not equal. If it's equal, 0.\n\nSo the function should return an array where each element is either 0 or the absolute difference between the guess and the game's score at that index.\n\nLet me look at the examples.\n\nFirst example:\ngame = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\nguess = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]\nThe output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n\nSo for each index:\n0: 1 vs 1 \u2192 0\n1: 2 vs 2 \u2192 0\n2: 3 vs 3 \u2192 0\n3: 4 vs 4 \u2192 0\n4: 5 vs 2 \u2192 3 (5-2=3)\n5: 1 vs -2 \u2192 3 (1 - (-2) is 3, but absolute difference is 3)\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the absolute difference is |5 - 2| = 3, and |1 - (-2)| is 3 as well. So the output is correct.\n\nSecond example:\ngame = [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4]\nguess = [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]\nThe output is [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]\n\nLet's compute each index:\n\n0: 0 vs 4 \u2192 |0-4|=4\n1:5 vs 1 \u2192 |5-1|=4\n2:0 vs 1 \u2192 |0-1|=1\n3:0 vs 0 \u2192 0\n4:0 vs 0 \u2192 0\n5:4 vs -2 \u2192 |4 - (-2)|=6\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSo the function needs to loop through each index, compare game[i] and guess[i], compute the absolute difference if they are not equal, else 0.\n\nSo in code, for each i in 0 to length-1:\n\nif game[i] == guess[i], then 0 else |game[i] - guess[i]|\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n"], ["//You will be given the name of a class (a string) and an array of extensions.\n// The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given a class name (a string) and an array of extensions. Each extension is a string. The goal is to find the strongest extension and return a string in the format \"ClassName.ExtensionName\". If multiple extensions have the same strength, we choose the one that comes first in the array.\n\nThe strength of an extension is calculated as follows: Let CAP be the number of uppercase letters in the extension's name, and SM be the number of lowercase letters. The strength is (CAP - SM).\n\nSo, for each extension in the array, we need to compute CAP and SM, then calculate strength as CAP - SM. Then, among all extensions, find the one with the maximum strength. If there's a tie, pick the one that appears first in the array.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each extension in the extensions array:\n   a. Count the number of uppercase letters (CAP).\n   b. Count the number of lowercase letters (SM).\n   c. Compute strength = CAP - SM.\n\n2. Find the extension(s) with the maximum strength.\n\n3. If there's only one such extension, return it as \"ClassName.Name\".\n\n4. If there are multiple, return the one that comes first in the array.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through each extension in the extensions array.\n- For each, calculate CAP and SM.\n- Keep track of the maximum strength and the corresponding extension name.\n- If an extension has a higher strength than the current maximum, update the maximum and the result.\n- If it's equal to the current maximum, only update if it's the first occurrence? Wait, no. Because we need to pick the first occurrence in case of ties. So, when we find an extension with the same strength as the current maximum, we should not replace it, because the first one comes earlier.\n\nWait, no. Because in the array, the first occurrence of the maximum strength is the one we need to choose. So, for example, if two extensions have the same strength, the one that appears first in the array is the one to choose.\n\nSo, in the algorithm, when processing each extension, we need to:\n\n- For each extension, compute strength.\n- If the strength is greater than the current maximum strength, update the maximum and the result.\n- If the strength is equal to the current maximum strength, but the extension comes before the current result, do not update. Because the current result is the first occurrence of the maximum strength.\n\nWait, no. Because the result is the first occurrence of the maximum strength. So, when processing extensions, if an extension has the same strength as the current maximum, but it comes before the current result, we should not update. Because the current result is the first occurrence of the maximum strength.\n\nSo, the algorithm should be:\n\nInitialize max_strength to -infinity, and result to null.\n\nFor each extension in the extensions array:\n\n   compute CAP and SM.\n\n   compute strength = CAP - SM.\n\n   if strength > max_strength:\n\n       max_strength = strength\n\n       result = extension\n\n   elif strength == max_strength:\n\n       // do not update, since the current result is the first occurrence.\n\n       // because the current result is the first occurrence of the maximum strength.\n\n       // So, if the current extension has the same strength, but it's later in the array, we don't replace.\n\nSo, in code, for each extension, we compute the strength. If it's higher than the current max, we update. If it's equal, we do not update. So, the first occurrence of the maximum"], ["//You are given 2 words.

Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe are given two words, a and b. We need to return true if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. So, for example, in the first sample, \"abcd\" and \"abd\" \u2014 the substring \"abd\" is present, so it returns true. But in the second sample, \"hello\" and \"ell\" \u2014 \"ell\" is a substring, so it returns true.\n\nSo, the task is to check whether any rotation of the second word is a substring of the first word.\n\nHmm. So, the approach is: generate all possible rotations of the second word, and for each rotation, check if it exists as a substring in the first word. If any of them do, return true; else, return false.\n\nBut wait, generating all rotations might be computationally expensive, especially if the second word is long. But given that the constraints are not provided, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to represent the rotations.\n\nWait, another approach: for a word, all its rotations can be generated by taking the word and rotating it by k positions, for k from 0 to len(word)-1. So, for each rotation, we can check if it's a substring of the first word.\n\nBut how to generate all rotations efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For a word of length n, each rotation can be represented as a substring of length n, starting at position i, where i ranges from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, no. Because a rotation is a cyclic permutation. So, for example, the word \"abcd\" has rotations \"abcd\", \"bcda\", \"cdab\", \"dabc\". So, each rotation is a substring of length 4, starting at each position.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the second word is \"abd\" \u2014 which is length 3. So, the rotations would be \"abd\", \"dba\", \"dab\". So, each rotation is a substring of length 3 in the first word.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each rotation of the second word, check if it is a substring of the first word.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible rotations of the second word, b.\n\n2. For each rotation, check if it is a substring of the first word, a.\n\n3. If any of them is, return true; else, return false.\n\nSo, the key is to generate all rotations of b and check each against a.\n\nBut how to generate all rotations?\n\nLet me think: for a word of length n, each rotation can be obtained by taking the substring starting at position i, and wrapping around to the beginning.\n\nSo, for example, for \"abcd\" (n=4), the rotations are:\n\ni=0: \"abcd\"\n\ni=1: \"bcda\"\n\ni=2: \"cdab\"\n\ni=3: \"dabc\"\n\nSo, for a word of length n, the rotations are the substrings starting at each index i, for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the second word is \"abd\" (n=3). So, the rotations are:\n\ni=0: \"abd\"\n\ni=1: \"dba\"\n\ni=2: \"dab\"\n\nSo, each rotation is a substring of length 3 in the first word.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For the second word, generate all possible rotations.\n\n- For each rotation, check if it is a substring of the first word.\n\n- If any rotation is found, return true.\n\n- Else, return false.\n\nSo, the first step is to generate all rotations of the second word.\n\nHow to generate all rotations?\n\nWell, for a word of length n, each rotation can be obtained by taking the substring starting at position i, and then appending the substring from the end to position i.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to take the word and for each possible rotation, create a new string by rotating it.\n\nAlternatively, for a word s, the rotations can be generated by s[i:] + s[:i] for i in 0 to len(s)-1.\n\nYes, that's a good way.\n\nSo, for example"], ["//Given an integer. return an array that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.\n// Example:\n// >>> even_odd_count(-12)\n// [1, 1]\n// >>> even_odd_count(123)\n// [1, 2]\nfunction even_odd_count(num){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to write a JavaScript function called even_odd_count that takes a number and returns an array with two elements: the first is the count of even digits, the second is the count of odd digits. \n\nLet me think about the steps I need to take.\n\nFirst, I need to process each digit of the number. But wait, the number can be negative. So, I should probably take the absolute value of the number to handle the negative sign. Because the negative sign isn't a digit, it's just a minus sign.\n\nSo, step one: convert the number to its absolute value, then split it into individual digits.\n\nHow can I do that in JavaScript? Well, I can convert the number to a string, then split on the ' ' (space) separator, which gives me an array of each character, which are the digits.\n\nFor example, if num is -12, converting to string gives \"-12\", then splitting gives [\"-\", \"1\", \"2\"]. Then, I can filter out the non-digit characters, but wait, in this case, the only non-digit is the \"-\". So, perhaps I can loop through each character and check if it's a digit.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a regular expression to extract all the digits. So, for \"-12\", the digits are \"1\" and \"2\".\n\nSo, perhaps the better approach is to use a regular expression to find all the digits in the number.\n\nYes, that's a good idea. So, I can write a regex that matches all the digits in the number, regardless of their position.\n\nSo, the regex would be /d+/g, which matches one or more digits.\n\nSo, for the number -12, the digits are '1' and '2'.\n\nOnce I have the array of digits, I can loop through each digit and check if it's even or odd.\n\nSo, for each digit, I can convert it to a number, then check if it's even or odd.\n\nWait, but in JavaScript, numbers can be even or odd, but when dealing with digits, each digit is a single number between 0 and 9.\n\nSo, for each digit, I can do:\n\ndigit % 2 === 0 \u2192 even\n\nelse \u2192 odd\n\nSo, I can initialize two counters, evenCount and oddCount, both starting at 0.\n\nThen, for each digit in the array:\n\nif (digit % 2 === 0) \u2192 increment evenCount\n\nelse \u2192 increment oddCount\n\nOnce all digits are processed, return an array [evenCount, oddCount].\n\nPutting it all together:\n"], ["//Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,\n// and return it in lowercase.\n// Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000\n// Examples:\n// >>> int_to_mini_roman(19)\n// \"xix\"\n// >>> int_to_mini_roman(152)\n// \"clii\"\n// >>> int_to_mini_roman(426)\n// \"cdxxvi\"\nfunction int_to_mini_roman(number){ ... }\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called int_to_mini_roman that converts a given positive integer into its Roman numeral equivalent as a string, and return it in lowercase. The number is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. \n\nFirst, I should think about how Roman numerals work. Roman numerals are made up of symbols that represent certain values. The basic symbols are:\n\n- I = 1\n- V = 5\n- X = 10\n- L = 50\n- C = 100\n- D = 500\n- M = 1000\n\nAnd the rules for combining these symbols are that if a smaller numeral comes before a larger one, it is subtracted; otherwise, it is added. For example, IV is 4 (5-1), IX is 9 (10-1), XL is 40 (50-10), etc.\n\nBut for numbers up to 1000, the standard approach is to use the additive method, except for the subtractive combinations. So, for numbers between 1 and 1000, we can break them down into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units, and then convert each part into Roman numerals.\n\nWait, but the maximum number is 1000, so we don't have to handle thousands. So, the function can focus on numbers from 1 to 1000.\n\nSo, the plan is to create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a value and its corresponding Roman numeral. The list should be ordered from the largest to the smallest value so that we can subtract the largest possible value each time.\n\nThe values and their numerals are:\n\n1000: M\n900: CM\n500: D\n400: CD\n100: C\n90: XC\n50: L\n40: XL\n10: X\n9: IX\n5: V\n4: IV\n1: I\n\nSo, the list would be:\n\n[\n(1000, 'M'),\n(900, 'CM'),\n(500, 'D'),\n(400, 'CD'),\n(100, 'C'),\n(90, 'XC'),\n(50, 'L'),\n(40, 'XL'),\n(10, 'X'),\n(9, 'IX'),\n(5, 'V'),\n(4, 'IV'),\n(1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for a given number, we loop through this list, and for each value, while the number is greater than or equal to the value, we append the corresponding numeral to the result string and subtract the value from the number. We repeat this until the number is less than the current value.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples given.\n\nFirst example: 19.\n\nWe start with 19. The largest value less than or equal to 19 is 10 (C). So, we append 'C' and subtract 10, leaving 9.\n\nNext, 9. The largest value less than or equal to 9 is 9 (IX). So, we append 'IX' and subtract 9, leaving 0. So, the result is 'C' + 'IX' = 'CIX', which is correct.\n\nSecond example: 152.\n\n152 is 100 + 50 + 2. So, 100 is 'C', 50 is 'L', and 2 is 'II'. So, the result is 'CLII', which is correct.\n\nThird example: 426.\n\n426 is 400 + 20 + 6. 400 is 'CD', 20 is 'X' (10+10), and 6 is 'VI'. So, the result is 'CDXXVI', which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe can create the list of tuples as described. Then, initialize an empty string result. Then, loop through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, if the number is greater than or equal to the value, we append the numeral to the result and subtract the value from the number. We continue this until the number is less than"], ["//Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.

The function should return true if these three sides form a right-angled triangle, and false otherwise.\n\nHmm, right-angled triangles have one angle that is exactly 90 degrees. The Pythagorean theorem is the key here. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is determine which of the three sides is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side of the triangle. So, I should find the largest among a, b, and c.\n\nWait, but what if two sides are equal? Like, if two sides are equal, then it's an isosceles triangle, but not necessarily right-angled. So, the hypotenuse is definitely the longest side.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the largest side among a, b, c. That will be the hypotenuse.\n2. Then, check if the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n3. If yes, return true; else, return false.\n\nBut wait, what if the given sides can't form a triangle? Because for a triangle to exist, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, even if the Pythagorean theorem holds, if the sides don't form a valid triangle, the function should return false.\n\nSo, I need to first check whether the three sides can form a valid triangle. If not, return false.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the three sides can form a valid triangle. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n\nWait, no. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for sides a, b, c:\n\na + b > c\n\na + c > b\n\nb + c > a\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, the three sides cannot form a triangle, so the function should return false.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if a, b, c can form a triangle. If not, return false.\n\nOnce we know that they can form a triangle, then we can proceed to check the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nSo, the function should:\n\n- Check if a, b, c can form a triangle. If not, return false.\n\n- Determine which of a, b, c is the largest (hypotenuse).\n\n- Check if (hypotenuse)^2 == (other two sides)^2.\n\n- If yes, return true; else, false.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, the function is given as:\n"], ["//Write a function that accepts an array of strings.\n// The array contains different words.

The function should return the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If there are multiple words with the same maximum number of unique characters, return the one that comes first in lexicographical order.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, for each word in the array, I need to calculate the number of unique characters it has. Then, find the word(s) with the highest count. If there's a tie, pick the one that appears first in the array.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through each word in the array.\n2. For each word, determine the number of unique characters.\n3. Keep track of the maximum number of unique characters found so far.\n4. If a word has more unique characters than the current maximum, update the maximum and record the word's position.\n5. If a word has the same number of unique characters as the current maximum, compare their positions. The word that appears first in the array should be chosen.\n6. After processing all words, return the word with the highest unique character count, or the first one in case of a tie.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the tie? Because if two words have the same maximum unique count, I need to return the one that comes first in the array. So, I need to track the order of words with the maximum count.\n\nSo, perhaps I should:\n\n- Keep track of the maximum unique count.\n- Keep a list of words that have this maximum count.\n- As I iterate through the array, for each word, calculate the unique count.\n- If the count is higher than the current maximum, update the maximum and reset the list to contain only this word.\n- If the count is equal to the current maximum, add the word to the list.\n- If the count is less than the current maximum, do nothing.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the list should only contain words that have the maximum count, and the first occurrence in the array is the one to return.\n\nWait, no. Because if a word comes before another word with the same maximum count, it should be the one to return.

If so, update the earliest word.\n   - Else:\n       - Do nothing.\n\nWait, but how do I compare the word's position in the array? Because the earliest word is the one that comes first in the array. So, for each word, if it has the same count as the current maximum, but it's earlier in the array, it should replace the current earliest word.\n\nSo, perhaps I should:\n\n- Keep track of the current maximum count and the earliest word with that count.\n\n- For each word in the array:\n   - Calculate the unique count.\n   - If the unique count is greater than the current maximum:\n       - Update the current maximum to this count.\n       - Update the earliest word to this current word.\n   - Else if the unique count is equal to the current maximum:\n       - If the current word comes before the earliest word, update the earliest word to this current word.\n   - Else:\n       - Do nothing.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given two arrays: operator and operand. The operator array contains basic algebra operations, and the operand array is an array of non-negative integers. We need to build an algebraic expression using these arrays and return the evaluation of the expression.\n\nThe example given is:\n\noperator = ['+', '*', '-']\noperand = [2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 = 9\n\nSo, the process is to take the operand array and use it to build an expression by applying the operator array in order. The first element of the operator array is applied to the first two elements of the operand array, then the result is used with the next element in the operator array, and so on until all elements are processed.\n\nWait, but how exactly are the operands and operators combined? Let's think about the example.\n\nOperand array is [2, 3, 4, 5], which has four elements. Operator array has three elements, which is one less than the operand array. So, the expression is built by combining the first two operands with the first operator, then the result with the next operator, and so on.\n\nSo, for the example:\n\n2 + 3 * 4 - 5\n\nWhich is 2 + (3 * 4) - 5 = 2 + 12 -5 = 9.\n\nSo, the way to build the expression is to start with the first operand, then apply each operator in sequence to the next operand.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nresult = operand[0]\nfor i from 1 to len(operand) - 1:\n    result = operator[i-1] applied to result and operand[i]\n\nWait, but in the example, the operator array is ['+', '*', '-'], which has three elements. The operand array has four elements. So, the number of operators is len(operand) - 1, which is 3, matching the operator array length.\n\nSo, the way to build the expression is to take the first operand, then for each operator in the operator array, apply it to the current result and the next operand.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize the result with the first operand.\n2. For each operator in the operator array:\n   a. Take the current result and the next operand.\n   b. Apply the operator to them.\n   c. Update the result with the new value.\n3. After processing all operators, return the result.\n\nSo, the function needs to process the operand array in a way that each operator is applied in sequence, starting with the first operand.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nLet's think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, the function is called do_algebra, and it takes two arguments: operator and operand.\n\nWe can start by initializing the result as the first element of the operand array.\n\nThen, for each operator in the operator array, we take the current result and the next operand, apply the operator, and update the result.\n\nWait, but the operand array is of length len(operator) + 1. So, for example, in the sample, operand is [2,3,4,5], which is 4 elements, operator is 3 elements.\n\nSo, the loop should run for len(operator) times, each time taking the next operand.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nlet result = operand[0];\nfor (let i = 0; i < operator.length; i++) {\n    let nextOperand = operand[i + 1];\n    let op = operator[i];\n    result = applyOperation(result, op, nextOperand);\n}\n\nSo, the key is to implement the applyOperation function, which takes two numbers and an operator, and returns the result of applying the operator.\n\nNow, the operators are: '+', '-', '*', '//', '**'.\n\nSo, in JavaScript, we can create a map or an object that"], ["//You are given a string s.\n// if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, \n// otherwise keep it as it is.\n// If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\n// The function should return the resulted string.\n// Examples\n// >>> solve(\"1234\")\n// \"4321\"\n// >>> solve(\"ab\")\n// \"AB\"\n// >>> solve(\"#a@C\")\n// \"#A@c\"\nfunction solve(s){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe are given a string s. If any character in the string is a letter (i.e., a lowercase or uppercase letter), we need to reverse its case. That is, if it's lowercase, make it uppercase, and vice versa. If the string contains no letters, we reverse the entire string. The function should return the resulting string.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is \"ab\", the output is \"AB\". If the input is \"#a@C\", the output is \"#A@c\". If the input is \"1234\", the output is \"4321\".\n\nHmm, okay. So the first thing I need to do is check each character in the string. For each character, if it's a letter, I need to change its case. If it's not a letter, I leave it as is.\n\nWait, but what about other characters? Like numbers, symbols, etc. They should remain unchanged.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. For each character, check if it's a letter (a-z or A-Z).\n3. If it is a letter, reverse its case.\n4. If it's not a letter, leave it as is.\n5. After processing all characters, if the resulting string has no letters, reverse the entire string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: if the string contains no letters, reverse the string. So, after processing, if there are no letters, then reverse the entire string.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\n\"If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\"\n\nSo, for example, if the input is \"1234\", which has no letters, we reverse the entire string, resulting in \"4321\".\n\nIf the input is \"ab\", which has letters, we reverse each letter's case, resulting in \"AB\".\n\nIf the input is \"#a@C\", which has letters, we reverse each letter's case, resulting in \"#A@c\".\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each character in s:\n   - if it's a letter, change its case.\n   - else, leave it as is.\n- After processing all characters, if the resulting string has no letters, reverse the entire string.\n\nWait, no.

Wait, the problem says: if the string contains no letters, reverse the string. So, the processing is done, and then if the resulting string has no letters, reverse it.\n\nWait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"if the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\"\n\nSo, for example, if the string is \"1234\", which has no letters, we reverse it to get \"4321\".\n\nIf the string is \"ab\", which has letters, we process each letter to reverse case, resulting in \"AB\".\n\nIf the string is \"#a@C\", which has letters, we process each letter to reverse case, resulting in \"#A@c\".\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each character in s:\n   a. if it's a letter, change its case.\n   b. else, leave it as is.\n2.

So, I can try to implement each step manually.\n\nBut that's going to be a lot of code. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a way to compute the MD5 hash using other methods, like using the built-in functions but without using any libraries.\n\nWait, but the problem says that I can't use any built-in functions or libraries.

For example, using the built-in"], ["//Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n// and b, in ascending order.\n// For example:\n// >>> generate_integers(2, 8)\n// [2, 4, 6, 8]\n// >>> generate_integers(8, 2)\n// [2, 4, 6, 8]\n// >>> generate_integers(10, 14)\n// []\nfunction generate_integers(a, b){ ... }\n}\n\nOkay, so I need to write a JavaScript function called generate_integers that takes two positive integers a and b and returns an array of even digits between a and b, in ascending order. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through each digit of a and b. But wait, a and b could be any numbers, right? So I need to process each digit individually, not just the entire number. So, for example, if a is 2 and b is 8, the digits are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. But I only want the even digits, which are 2,4,6,8. So the output is [2,4,6,8].\n\nAnother example: if a is 8 and b is 2, the digits are 8,7,6,5,4,3,2. The even digits are 8,6,4,2, so the output is [2,4,6,8] because the order is ascending.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output is in ascending order, but the digits are processed from a to b. So perhaps the approach is to process each number from a to b, extract each digit, check if it's even, and collect them in an array, then sort the array in ascending order.\n\nWait, but the example shows that the output is in ascending order regardless of the order of a and b. So, for example, if a is 8 and b is 2, the output is [2,4,6,8], which is the same as if a was 2 and b was 8.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each number from a to b (inclusive), process each digit.\n2. For each digit, check if it's even.\n3. If it is, add it to an array.\n4. After processing all numbers, sort the array in ascending order.\n5. Return the sorted array.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the numbers are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The even digits are 2,4,6,8. So the array is [2,4,6,8], which is already in order. But if a is 8 and b is 2, the numbers are 8,7,6,5,4,3,2. The even digits are 8,6,4,2. So the array would be [8,6,4,2], but the output is [2,4,6,8]. So perhaps after collecting all even digits, we need to sort them in ascending order.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n- Initialize an empty array to collect even digits.\n- Loop through each number from a to b (inclusive).\n- For each number, extract each digit.\n- For each digit, check if it's even.\n- If it is, add it to the array.\n- After processing all numbers, sort the array in ascending order.\n- Return the sorted array.\n\nSo, the first thing is to loop through each number from a to b. Then, for each number, extract each digit. How to extract each digit? Well, one way is to repeatedly divide the number by 10 and take the remainder. For example, for 24, 24 % 10 is 4, then 24 / 10 is 2, then 2 % 10 is 2, then 2 /10 is 0, so we stop.\n\nSo, for each number, we can extract each digit by using a loop that divides the number by 10 each time, taking the remainder each time.\n\nOnce we have each digit, we check if it's even. If it is, we add it to the array.\n\nOnce all numbers are processed, we sort the array in ascending order.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this in JavaScript.\n\nFirst, create an empty array called result.\n\nThen, loop from a to b, inclusive. So for (let num = a; num <= b; num++).\n\nInside this loop, for each num, extract each digit.\n\nWe can do this by initializing a variable, say, currentDigit, to 0.\n\nThen, while num is greater than 0, do:\n\ncurrentDigit"]]
