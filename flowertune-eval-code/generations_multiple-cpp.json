So, for example, if the input is (1,2,3), the output is (1,4,2,4,3). How can I do this in Python?\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to write a Python function that takes a vector of longs and a long value, and returns a new vector where each element from the original vector is followed by the delimeter value, except for the last element. This way, every two consecutive elements in the original vector are separated by the delimeter.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The function is called intersperse, but in Python, I'll name it something like interleave. The function takes two arguments: a vector of longs (numbers) and a long (delimeter). It should return a new vector of longs.\n\nSo, for example, if numbers is (1, 2, 3), the output should be (1, 4, 2, 4, 3). Each element is followed by the delimeter, except the last one.\n\nHow can I achieve this in Python? One way is to iterate through each element in the numbers vector, and for each element, add it to the result vector, followed by the delimeter. But wait, that would add the delimeter after the last element, which is not desired. So, perhaps I should loop through each element except the last one, and for each, add the element and then the delimeter to the result. Then, after the loop, add the last element without adding the delimeter.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a new list. For each element in numbers, I can add it to the new list, and then add the delimeter. But then, after the loop, I need to add the last element without adding the delimeter.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list called result.\n2. Loop through each element in numbers:\n   a. Append the current element to result.\n   b. Append the delimeter to result.\n3. After the loop, append the last element of numbers to result.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first step, for each element, we add it and then the delimeter. So, for example, for the first element, we have [element, delimeter]. For the second element, [element, delimeter], and so on. Then, after the loop, we add the last element. So, the result would be [element1, delimeter, element2, delimeter, ..., elementN]. But that's not correct because the last element should not have the delimeter added.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's take the example where numbers is (1,2,3). The desired output is (1,4,2,4,3). So, the process is:\n\n- Start with an empty result.\n- Take the first element, 1: add 1, then add 4. So result is [1,4].\n- Take the second element, 2: add 2, then add 4. So result is [1,4,2,4].\n- Take the third element, 3: add 3. So result is [1,4,2,4,3].\n\nYes, that works. So the steps are:\n\n- For each element in numbers:\n   - Append the element to result.\n   - Append the delimeter to result.\n- After the loop, append the last element of numbers to result.\n\nWait, no. Because in the loop, for each element, we add the element and then the delimeter. So for the third element, 3, we add 3 and then 4. Then, after the loop, we add the last element, which is 3, without adding the delimeter. So the result is [1,4,2,4,3], which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because in the loop, for each element, we add the element and then the delimeter. So for the third element, 3, we add 3 and then 4"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.\n// For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.\n// E.g.

Hmm, let's think about the examples given.\n\nIn the first example, the string is empty and the substring is \"a\". The output is 0 because there's nothing to match. That makes sense.\n\nIn the second example, the string is \"aaa\" and the substring is \"a\". The output is 3. So, each 'a' is counted, including overlapping ones. Wait, how does that work? Let me see: the string is \"aaa\", so positions 0, 1, 2 are 'a's. So, the first 'a' is at 0, then 1, then 2. So, 3 times.\n\nIn the third example, the string is \"aaaa\" and the substring is \"aa\". The output is 3. Let's see: positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3. So, three times. So, overlapping is allowed.\n\nSo, the task is to count all possible occurrences, including overlapping ones.\n\nHow can I approach this in code?\n\nI think I can iterate through the string, and for each position, check if the substring starts there. If it does, increment the count and move the position forward by the length of the substring. If not, move forward by one.\n\nWait, but in the case of overlapping, the substring can start at position i, and then also at i+1, etc., as long as the substring is within the string.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nLoop through each index i from 0 to len(string) - len(substring):\n\n   if substring starts at i, then count +=1, and i += len(substring)\n\nSo, for each i, check if the substring matches starting at i. If yes, count increases by 1, and i is incremented by the length of the substring.\n\nThis way, overlapping cases are handled.\n\nBut wait, what if the substring is longer than the string? Then len(string) - len(substring) is negative, so the loop won't run, and count remains 0.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nint count = 0;\n\nint n = string.size();\n\nint m = substring.size();\n\nif (m > n) return 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {\n\n   if (string.substr(i, m) == substring) {\n\n      count++;\n\n      i += m;\n\n   }\n"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.\n// Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.\n// Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest\n// >>> sort_numbers((\"three one five\"))\n// (\"one three five\")\nstd::string sort_numbers(std::string numbers) { ... }"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// From a supplied vector of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each\n// other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).\n// >>> find_closest_elements((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.0f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)2.2f})))\n// (std::make_tuple(2.0f, 2.2f))\n// >>> find_closest_elements((std::vector<float>({(float)1.0f, (float)2.0f, (float)3.0f, (float)4.0f, (float)5.0f, (float)2.0f})))\n// (std::make_tuple(2.0f, 2.0f))\nstd::tuple<float, float> find_closest_elements(std::vector<float> numbers) { ... }\n```\n\nI need to fill in the code for the function.

So, the solution needs to be efficient.\n\nSo, the function should return a tuple of two floats, the two closest numbers in the vector. The vector can have up to 1000 elements. So, the solution needs to be efficient.\n\nSo, the function should return a tuple of two floats, the two closest numbers in the vector. The vector can have up to 1000 elements. So, the solution needs to be efficient.\n\nOkay, so the function is supposed to take a vector of floats and return a tuple of two floats that are the closest to each other. The vector can have up to 1000 elements, so the solution needs to be efficient.\n\nHmm, okay, so the first thing I need to do is find the two numbers in the vector that are closest to each other. How can I do that efficiently?\n\nWell, one approach is to sort the vector first, and then iterate through the sorted vector to find the pair of consecutive elements that have the smallest difference. That makes sense because, in a sorted array, the closest elements are next to each other.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the vector of floats in ascending order.\n2. Iterate through the sorted vector, comparing each pair of consecutive elements.\n3. Keep track of the pair with the smallest difference.\n4. Return this pair as a tuple.\n\nBut wait, the vector can have up to 1000 elements, so sorting it is manageable. Sorting 1000 elements is not a problem computationally.\n\nSo, let's outline the code.\n\nFirst, I'll sort the vector:\n\nnumbers.sort();\n\nThen, I'll initialize variables to keep track of the smallest difference and the corresponding pair.\n\nI can initialize min_diff to a large value, like the maximum possible difference between two elements, and min_pair as the first two elements.\n\nThen, I'll loop from the second element to the end of the vector:\n\nfor (int i = 1;

The function should filter out non-integer values and return them in a new vector.\n\nWait, but the input is a vector of any type, so I need to check each element to see if it's an integer. But how do I determine if an element is an integer? Because in C++, there are multiple types that can be considered integers, like int, long, long long, etc. But in this problem, the function is supposed to return only the integers, so perhaps it's intended to return only the elements that are of type int or long or long long.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the input is a vector of std::any, which includes various types. So, the function needs to iterate through each element, check if it's an integer, and if so, add it to the output vector.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Create an empty vector<long> result.\n2. Iterate over each element in the input vector.\n3. For each element, check if it is an integer. How? Well, in C++, you can check the type of the element. So, for each element, check if it is an instance of int, long, or long long. But wait, in C++, there's also the possibility of using other integer types, like short or unsigned short, but the problem statement doesn't mention them, so perhaps we can assume that the function is intended to filter only int and long types.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"filter given vector of any cppthon values only for integers\". Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to filter out any non-integer values, regardless of their type. So, for example, if an element is a float, even if it's a whole number, it should be excluded. Similarly, if an element is a boolean, it should be excluded.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each element in the input vector, check if it is an integer. How to do that?\n\nIn C++, you can check the type of the element using the type assertion. So, for each element, you can use a type assertion to determine if it's an integer.\n\nWait, but in C++, you can't directly check the type of an element in a function like that. So, perhaps the function can use a type assertion to determine if the element is an integer.\n\nSo, for each element in the input vector, the function can check if it is an integer by using a type assertion. For example, for each element, if (element is an integer), then add it to the result vector.\n\nBut wait, how do you perform this check in C++? Because in C++, you can't directly check the type of an element in a function like that. So, perhaps the function can use a type assertion to determine if the element is an integer.\n\nWait, but the type assertion is a macro, so perhaps the function can use a type assertion to check if the element is an integer.\n\nSo, the code would look something like this:\n\nfor each element in values:\n    if (is integer)\n        add to result\n\nBut how to implement this in C++.\n\nWait, perhaps the function can use a type assertion to check if the element is an integer.

The function should return a vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector. If there are no positive numbers, it should return an empty vector. The function should not modify the input vector.\n\nSo, I need to think about how to iterate through each element of the input vector, check if it's positive, and collect those elements into a new vector.\n\nFirst, I'll need to create a new vector, say result, which will hold the positive numbers.\n\nThen, for each element in the input vector l, I'll check if it's greater than zero. If it is, I'll add it to the result vector.\n\nWait, but what about zero? The problem says to return positive numbers, so zero should be excluded. So, the condition should be if (element > 0).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Create an empty vector to store the result.\n2. Iterate over each element in the input vector l.\n3. For each element, check if it's greater than zero.\n4. If it is, add it to the result vector.\n5. After processing all elements, return the result vector.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nThe function is given as:\n\nstd::vector<long> get_positive(std::vector<long> l) { ... }\n\nSo, inside the function, I'll create a new vector, perhaps using std::vector<long> result; Then, loop through each element in l.\n\nWait, but in C++, when you have a vector, you can loop through it using a range-based for loop. So, for (auto num : l) { ... }\n\nYes, that's the way to go.\n\nSo, the code inside the function would be:\n\nstd::vector<long> result;\nfor (auto num : l) {\n    if (num > 0) {\n

You may need to use std::vector, std::long, etc.\n// ... You may need to use std::vector, std::long, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nOkay, so the task is to write a function called max_element that takes a vector of longs and returns the maximum element in that vector. The function is supposed to return a long, which is the maximum value.\n\nHmm, I remember that in C++, to find the maximum element in a vector, you can use the std::max_element function from the <algorithm> header. But wait, I'm not sure if that's allowed here or if I need to implement it myself. The problem statement says to return the maximum element, so I think using the built-in function is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if the function is allowed to use it. The problem says that I can use std::vector, std::long, etc., so I think it's allowed. So, the function can be written as:\n\nlong max_element(std::vector<long> l) {\n    return std::max_element(l);"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Return the number of times the

that takes a string and returns a new string without the vowels. Hmm, vowels are a, e, i, o, u, both lowercase and uppercase. So I need to check each character in the input string and include it in the output only if it's not a vowel.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return a string without vowels. So I can't modify the original string, I have to create a new string. So I'll probably create a new string, let's say result, and loop through each character in the input text.\n\nFor each character in text, I'll check if it's a vowel. If it's not, I'll add it to the result. Otherwise, I'll skip it.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize an empty string result.\n2. Loop through each character in the input string text.\n3. For each character, check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, both lowercase and uppercase).\n4. If it's not a vowel, append it to result.\n5. After processing all characters, return the result.\n\nHow to implement this in C++.\n\nFirst, I'll include the necessary headers. The function is given, so I don't need to add anything else.\n\nInside the function:\n\nstd::string result;\n\nThen, loop through each character in text:\n\nfor (char c : text) {\n\n   // check if c is a vowel\n\n   if (is_vowel(c)) {\n      // it's a vowel, skip\n      continue;\n   } else {\n      result.push_back(c);\n   }\n"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Return true if all numbers in the vector l are below threshold t.\n// >>> below_threshold((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2, (long)4, (long)10})), (100))\n// (true)\n// >>> below_threshold((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)20, (long)4, (long)10})), (5))\n// (false)\nbool below_threshold(std::vector<long> l, long t) { ... }\n// ... other code\n// Write a function that returns true if all numbers in the vector l are below threshold t.\n// So, for each number in l, check if it is less than t. If any is not, return false. Otherwise, return true.\n\nOkay, I need to write a C++ function called below_threshold that takes a vector of longs and a long threshold t, and returns a boolean indicating whether all elements in the vector are below t.\n\nSo, the function is supposed to return true if every element in the vector is less than t. Otherwise, it returns false.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to loop through each element in the vector l. For each element, I check if it is less than t. If any element is not less than t, the function should return false immediately.\n\nIf I finish checking all elements and none of them are >= t, then the function returns true.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the vector l.\n2. For each element, compare it with t.\n3. If any element is >= t, return false.\n4. If all elements are < t, return true.\n\nNow, in C++, how can I loop through each element of a vector?\n\nI can use a for loop, starting from 0 to l.size() - 1.\n\nInside the loop, for each i, I access l[i].\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {\n    if (l[i] >= t) {\n        return false;\n    }"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Add

If they are not, we can immediately return `false` since they cannot have the same characters.\n2. **Count Character Frequencies**: If the lengths are the same, we then count the frequency of each character in both strings. If the frequency counts of both strings are identical, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine if the two strings have the same characters by leveraging the concept of character frequency counting.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool same_chars(string s0, string s1) {\n    // If the lengths of the two strings are different, they cannot have the same characters.\n    if (s0.size() != s1.size()) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // Count the frequency of each character in both strings.\n    // We use the standard library's unordered_map for this purpose.\n    unordered_map<char, int> count0;\n    unordered_map<char, int> count1;\n    \n    for (char c : s0) {\n        count0[c]++;\n    }\n    for (char c : s1) {\n        count1[c]++;\n    }\n    \n    // Compare the two maps.

Here's a step-by-step explanation and implementation:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: A vector is monotonically increasing if each element is greater than or equal to the previous one. Similarly, it is monotonically decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the previous one.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the vector is empty or has only one element. An empty vector is trivially monotonic, and a single-element vector is also trivially monotonic.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Vector**: Compare each element with the previous one. If any element is less than the previous one (for a decreasing vector) or greater than the previous one (for an increasing vector), the vector is not monotonic.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Based on the comparisons, return true if the vector is monotonic, and false otherwise.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <assert.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool monotonic(vector<long> l) {\n    if (l.size() <= 1) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    \n    bool increasing = true;\n    bool decreasing = true;\n    \n    for (size_t i = 1; i < l.size(); ++i) {\n        if (l[i] < l[i-1]) {\n            decreasing = true;\n        } else if (l[i] > l[i-1]) {\n            increasing = true;\n        } else {\n            // Elements are equal, so the vector is still monotonic\n            continue;\n        }\n        \n        // If both increasing and decreasing are true, the vector is not monotonic\n        if (increasing && decreasing) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return increasing || decreasing;"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Return sorted unique common elements for two vectors.\n// >>> common((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)4, (long)3, (long)34, (long)653, (long)2, (long)5})), (std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)7, (long)1, (long)5, (long)9, (long)653, (long)121})))\n// (std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)5, (long)653}))\n// >>> common((std::vector<long>({(long)5, (long)3, (long)2, (long)8})), (std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2})))\n// (std::vector<long>({(long)2, (long)3}))\nstd::vector<long> common(std::vector<long> l1, std::vector<long> l2) { ... }\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the sorted unique common elements between two vectors of long integers. The solution should efficiently identify these common elements and return them in a sorted order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given two vectors of long integers and need to find the common elements between them. The result should be a vector containing these common elements in sorted order, without any duplicates.\n\n2. **Intuition**: The problem can be approached by first identifying the unique elements in each vector. Once we have the unique elements from both vectors, we can find the intersection of these sets, which gives us the common elements. Finally, we sort these common elements to get the desired result.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Unique Elements**: We can use a set to store the unique elements of each vector. A set automatically handles duplicates and provides an efficient way to check for the presence of elements.\n   - **Intersection**: The intersection of two sets can be found using the `set_intersection` function from the C++ Standard Library.\n   - **Sorting**: Once we have the intersection, we need to sort the elements to meet the problem's requirement of returning them in sorted order.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of common elements. The set operations (creating sets, finding intersection) are all linear in the size of the input vectors.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(m) where m is the number of unique elements in the input vectors. This is because we need to store the unique elements of both vectors.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <set>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nstd::vector<long> common(std::vector<long> l1, std::vector<long> l2) {\n    std::set<long> s1(l1.begin(), l1.end());\n    std::set<long> s2(l2.begin(), l2.end());\n    std::set<long> intersection(s1.begin(), s1.end());\n    intersection.insert(intersection.end(), s2.begin(), s2.end());\n    std::vector<long> result(intersection.begin(), intersection.end());\n    std::sort(result.begin(), result.end());\n    return result;"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Return the largest prime factor of n.

But I'm not sure how to approach this. Can you help me?\n\nOkay, I need to write a function that sums numbers from 1 to n. So, for example, if n is 30, the sum is 1+2+3+...+30 = 465. Similarly, for n=100, the sum is 5050, and so on.\n\nWait, but what if n is 0? Or negative? The problem statement doesn't specify, but in the examples, n is positive. So perhaps the function is intended to handle positive integers only.\n\nSo, the function sum_to_n takes a long n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to implement this in C++. The function is given as:\n\nlong sum_to_n(long n) { ... }\n\nBut wait, the function is declared as taking a long n, but in the examples, the function is called with 30, 100, etc., which are positive. So perhaps the function is intended to handle n >= 1.\n\nBut what about n=0? The sum from 1 to 0 is 0, but the function would return 0. But perhaps the function is intended to handle n >=1.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the function should handle n >=0.\n\nBut let's think about the function's behavior.\n\nIf n is 0, the sum is 0.\n\nIf n is 1, the sum is 1.\n\nIf n is 2, the sum is 3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the function needs to compute the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n\nNow, the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n*(n+1)/2.\n\nSo, for example, when n=30, 30*31/2 = 465.\n\nSo, the function can be implemented using this formula.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\nlong

}\n```\n\nI need to fill in the empty space between the comments and return the correct derivative. So, I need to think about the problem carefully and then write the code.\n\nOkay, so the problem is to compute the derivative of a polynomial given by a vector of coefficients. Each element in the vector represents the coefficient of x raised to the power of its index. For example, if the vector is {a0, a1, a2, a3}, the polynomial is a0 + a1x + a2x\u00b2 + a3x\u00b3.\n\nThe derivative of this polynomial is computed by taking the derivative of each term. The derivative of a term a_n x^n is n * a_n x^(n-1). So, for each coefficient, we multiply it by its exponent and then reduce the exponent by one.\n\nSo, for the example given in the problem:\n\nInput: {3, 1, 2, 4, 5}\n\nThe polynomial is 3 + 1x + 2x\u00b2 + 4x\u00b3 + 5x\u2074.\n\nThe derivative is computed as follows:\n\n- The derivative of 3 is 0 (since the derivative of a constant is zero).\n- The derivative of 1x is 1 (since 1 * 1x^(1-1) = 1).\n- The derivative of 2x\u00b2 is 4x (since 2 * 2x^(2-1) = 4x).\n- The derivative of 4x\u00b3 is 12x\u00b2 (since 4 * 3x^(3-1) = 12x\u00b2).\n- The derivative of 5x\u2074 is 20x\u00b3 (since 5 * 4x^(4-1) = 20x\u00b3).\n\nSo, the resulting coefficients are [1, 4, 12, 20], which is the output.\n\nAnother example given is {1, 2, 3}, which represents the polynomial 1 + 2x + 3x\u00b2. The derivative is 2 + 6x, which is represented as [2, 6].\n\nSo, the task is to write a function that takes a vector of long integers and returns a new vector of long integers representing the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in C++. The function is given as:\n\nstd::vector<long> derivative(std::vector<long> xs) { ... }\n\nWe need to compute the derivative and return it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the steps:\n\n1. Check if the input vector is empty or has only one element. If it's empty, the derivative is also empty. If it's a single element, the derivative is zero because the derivative of a constant is zero.\n\n2. For each element in the input vector, starting from the first index (since the derivative of the constant term is zero), compute the derivative coefficient as (index * coefficient) and then reduce the exponent by one. So, for the i-th element (starting from 0), the derivative coefficient is i * xs[i], and the new exponent is i-1.\n\n3. However, in the output vector, we need to collect these coefficients in order. So, for each i from 1 to the end of the vector (since i=0 gives 0, which is the constant term and can be ignored), we compute the derivative coefficient and add it to the result vector.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. The input vector is xs, where xs[0] is the coefficient of x^0 (constant term), xs[1] is x^1, etc. So, the derivative is computed as follows:\n\nFor each term xs[i] * x^i, the derivative is i * xs[i] * x^(i-1). So, for each i >= 1, we have a term in the derivative.\n\nSo, the output vector will have elements for i from 1 to n-1 (where n is the size of xs). Each element is i * xs[i].\n\nBut wait"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:\n// fibfib(0) == 0\n// fibfib(1) == 0\n// fibfib(2) == 1\n// fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).\n// Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.\n// >>> fibfib((1))\n// (0)\n// >>> fibfib((5))\n// (4)\n// >>> fibfib((8))\n// (24)\nlong fibfib(long n) { ... }\n// ... }\n\nOkay, I need to write a function to compute the n-th element of the fibfib sequence. The function is called fibfib and takes a long n as input. The sample inputs and outputs are given, but I need to figure out how to compute this efficiently.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the definition:\n\nfibfib(0) == 0\nfibfib(1) == 0\nfibfib(2) == 1\nfibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)\n\nSo, for n >= 3, each term is the sum of the previous three terms.\n\nThe sample inputs:\n\nfibfib(1) returns 0\nfibfib(5) returns 4\nfibfib(8) returns 24\n\nLet me compute the sequence up to n=8 to see if it matches.\n\nCompute fibfib(0) = 0\nfibfib(1) = 0\nfibfib(2) = 1\nfibfib(3) = fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) + fibfib(0) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\nfibfib(4) = fibfib(3) + fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2\nfibfib(5) = fibfib(4) + fibfib(3) + fibfib(2) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\nfibfib(6) = fibfib(5) + fibfib(4) + fibfib(3) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7\nfibfib(7) = fibfib(6) + fibfib(5) + fibfib(4) = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13\nfibfib(8) = fibfib(7) + fibfib(6) + fibfib(5) = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24\n\nYes, that matches the sample. So the function needs to compute this correctly.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute fibfib(n) efficiently. Since n can be up to a large value, a naive recursive approach would be too slow. We need an iterative approach with O(n) time complexity.\n\nBut wait, for n up to 1e6 or even 1e9, an O(n) approach might be too slow. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the constraints are manageable with O(n) time, but for very large n, we might need a more optimized approach, perhaps using matrix exponentiation or fast doubling.\n\nBut given that the problem is in a coding challenge, perhaps the expected solution is an iterative approach with O(n) time and O(1) space.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Handle the base cases: if n is 0 or 1, return 0. If n is 2, return 1.\n\n2. For n >= 3, compute each term iteratively, starting from n=3 up to the desired n.\n\n3. Keep track of the previous three terms, since each term depends on the previous three.\n\nSo, let's think about variables:\n\nWe can have variables a, b, c, where:\n\na = fibfib(n-3)\nb = fibfib(n-2)\nc = fibfib(n-1)\n\nThen, for each step, the next term is a + b + c.\n\nBut wait, for n=3, the term is 1, which is a=0, b=0, c=1? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial terms:\n\nfibfib(0) = 0\n\nfibfib(1) = 0\n\nfibfib(2) = 1\n\nfibfib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1) + fib(0) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\n\nfibfib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2) + fib(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2\n\nfibfib"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing\n// a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.\n// Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.

The sorting process involves alternating between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining elements in the vector. This process continues until all elements have been considered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` starts at the beginning of the vector and `j` starts at the end.\n2. **Alternate Sorting**: While there are elements left to consider, compare the values at `i` and `j`. If `i` has a smaller value, place it at `i` and increment `i`. If `j` has a smaller value, place it at `j` and decrement `j`.\n3. **Handle Equal Values**: If the values at `i` and `j` are equal, place the value at `i` and increment `i`.\n4. **Termination**: Continue this process until all elements have been considered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we alternate between the minimum and maximum values, effectively sorting the vector in the desired \"strange\" order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nstd::vector<long> strange_sort_list(std::vector<long> lst) {\n    int i = 0;\n    int j = lst.size() - 1;\n    while (i < j) {\n        if (lst[i] < lst[j]) {\n            std::swap(lst[i], lst[j]);\n            i++;\n        } else if (lst[i] > lst[j]) {\n            std::swap(lst[i], lst[j]);\n            j--;\n        } else {\n            i++;\n        }\n    }\n    return lst;"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.

If the sides form a valid triangle, I return the area rounded to two decimal points. Otherwise, I return -1.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a triangle to be valid, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, I need to check all three conditions: a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. If any of these are not true, the triangle is invalid, and I should return -1.\n\nOnce I confirm that the triangle is valid, I can proceed to calculate the area. I recall Heron's formula, which is a way to find the area of a triangle when all three sides are known. Heron's formula states that the area is the square root of s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c), where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if the given sides can form a valid triangle.\n   - Calculate the sum of each pair of sides and compare it with the third side.\n   - If any of these sums are less than or equal to the third side, return -1.\n\n2. If the triangle is valid, calculate the semi-perimeter (s) using the formula s = (a + b + c) / 2.\n\n3. Use Heron's formula to compute the area: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)).\n\n4. Round the computed area to two decimal places and return it.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the function is given as float triangle_area(long a, long b, long c). So, the function takes three long integers as parameters.\n\nLet me think about the data types. Since the sides are long, but the area is a float, I need to handle possible precision issues. But for the purposes of this problem, I think it's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, the function is given as:\n\nfloat triangle_area(long a, long b, long c) { ... }\n\nSo, the function returns a float.\n\nInside the function:\n\nFirst, I need to check if the sides can form a triangle.\n\nSo, I'll compute the three sums:\n\nsum1 = a + b\nsum2 = a + c\nsum3 = b + c\n\nThen, check if all of these are greater than the third side.\n\nWait, no. The condition is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, for a triangle with sides a, b, c, all three of the following must be true:\n\na + b > c\na + c > b\nb + c > a\n\nSo, I need to check all three conditions.\n\nIf any of these is false, return -1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a) {\n    return -1;"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Write a function that returns true if the object q will fly, and false otherwise.\n// The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic vector) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.\n// Example:\n// >>> will_it_fly((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)2})), (5))\n// (false)\n// # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.\n// >>> will_it_fly((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)3})), (1))\n// (false)\n// # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.\n// >>> will_it_fly((std::vector<long>({(long)3, (long)2, (long)3})), (9))\n// (true)\n// # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\n// >>> will_it_fly((std::vector<long>({(long)3})), (5))\n// (true)\n// # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.\nbool will_it_fly(std::vector<long> q, long w) { ... }\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given vector of long values is balanced and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to a given maximum weight. If both conditions are met, the function should return true; otherwise, it should return false.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Balance**: A vector is considered balanced if it reads the same forwards and backwards. This means the vector must be a palindrome.\n2. **Check Sum Against Maximum Weight**: The sum of the elements in the vector must be less than or equal to the given maximum weight.\n\nThe approach involves two main steps:\n1. **Palindrome Check**: We need to check if the vector is a palindrome. This can be done by comparing the vector with its reverse.\n2. **Sum Check**: Calculate the sum of the elements in the vector and compare it with the given maximum weight.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <numeric>\n#include <assert.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool will_it_fly(vector<long> q, long w) {\n    // Check if the vector is a palindrome\n    if (q != reverse(q)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // Calculate the sum of the elements\n    long sum = accumulate(q.begin(), q.end(), 0);\n    \n    // Check if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight\n    return sum <= w;"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Given a vector arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that\n// need to be changed to make the vector palindromic.

Let me think about the examples given.\n\nIn the first example, the vector is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]. The output is 4. So, they changed 4 elements to make it a palindrome. How?\n\nWait, a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So, the first element should equal the last, the second should equal the second last, and so on.\n\nLooking at the original vector: 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6.\n\nLet's pair them:\n\n1 and 6 (positions 0 and 7)\n2 and 9 (positions 1 and 6)\n3 and 7 (positions 2 and 5)\n5 and 4 (positions 3 and 4)\n\nSo, the pairs are (1,6), (2,9), (3,7), (5,4). Now, for the vector to be a palindrome, each pair should be equal.\n\nIn the original vector, the pairs are:\n\n1 vs 6: not equal\n2 vs 9: not equal\n3 vs 7: not equal\n5 vs 4: not equal\n\nSo, all four pairs are mismatched. To make it a palindrome, we need to change some elements so that each pair is equal.\n\nBut wait, the output is 4, which is the number of elements changed. So, how?\n\nWait, each pair has two elements. To make them equal, we can change one of them. For example, if we change 1 to 6, then the pair becomes 6 and 6, which is a palindrome. Similarly, if we change 6 to 1, same result. So, for each mismatched pair, we can change one element to make them equal.\n\nBut in the first example, the output is 4, which is the number of elements changed. So, for each of the four mismatched pairs, we need to change one element. So, 4 changes.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output is 4, which is the number of elements changed. So, that makes sense.\n\nIn the second example, the vector is [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]. The output is 1.\n\nLooking at the pairs:\n\n1 and 2 (positions 0 and 6)\n2 and 2 (positions 1 and 5)\n3 and 3 (positions 2 and 4)\n4 and 2 (positions 3 and 3)\n\nSo, the mismatched pairs are (1,2) and (4,2). So, two mismatched pairs. To make them equal, we can change one element in each pair.\n\nFor example, change 1 to 2, making the pair (2,2). Or change 2 to 1, making (1,2). Either way, one change per pair. So, two changes in total.\n\nBut the output is 1. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, the output is 1. So, how?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the function is supposed to find the minimum number of changes required to make the vector a palindrome, but perhaps the way the pairs are considered is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is supposed to find the minimal number of changes, but perhaps the pairs are considered in a way that allows for some changes to be made in a way that reduces the total number of changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to find the minimal number of changes, but perhaps the way the pairs are considered is that each pair can be made"],

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to check if the length of the string is a prime number. If the length is a prime number, the function should return `true`; otherwise, it should return `false`.\n2. **Prime Number Check**: To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. The most efficient way to do this is to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any number in this range divides the number evenly, it is not a prime number.\n3. **Edge Cases**: We need to handle edge cases such as when the string length is 0 or 1. Since 0 and 1 are not prime numbers, the function should return `false` for these cases.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <string>\n#include <cmath>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool prime_length(string s) {\n    int n = s.length();\n    if (n <= 1) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {\n        if (n % i == 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n// positive integers that start or end with 1.\nlong starts_one_ends(long n) { ... }\nlong starts_one_ends(long n) { ... }\nlong starts_one_ends(long n) { ... }\n\nWait, the code is not correct. I need to write a correct implementation of the function starts_one_ends which returns the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.\n\nSo, the function starts_one_ends is given a positive integer n, and returns the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.\n\nSo, for example, n=1: the count is 2 (1 and 10? Wait, no. Wait, n=1 is a single-digit number. So, numbers that start or end with 1. But for n=1, the only number is 1, which starts and ends with 1. So the count is 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"start or end with 1\". So for n=1, the number is 1, which starts and ends with 1. So count is 1.\n\nWait, but what about n=2? The two-digit numbers that start or end with 1. So numbers from 10 to 99.\n\nNumbers that start with 1: 10-19, which is 10 numbers.\n\nNumbers that end with 1: 11, 21, ..., 91. That's 9 numbers.\n\nBut wait, 11 is counted in both. So total is 10 + 9 - 1 = 18.\n\nSo for n=2, the count is 18.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return the count of numbers that start or end with 1. So the formula is: numbers starting with 1 plus numbers ending with 1 minus numbers that both start and end with 1.\n\nSo, for n-digit numbers, the count is:\n\ncount_start = 10^(n-1) (since first digit is 1, and the rest can be anything)\n\ncount_end = 10^(n-1) (since last digit is 1, and the rest can be anything)\n\ncount_both = 10^(n-2) (since first digit is 1 and last digit is 1, the rest can be anything)\n\nSo total is count_start + count_end - count_both.\n\nSo for n=1: count_start = 1, count_end = 1, count_both = 0 (since n-2 is -1, which is 0). So total is 1+1-0=2. But wait, n=1, the only number is 1, which is counted in both. So the formula gives 2, but the correct count is 1.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the formula is correct for n >= 2, but for n=1, it's different.\n\nSo, for n=1, the count is 1.\n\nFor n >=2, the count is 2*10^(n-1) - 10^(n-2).\n\nWait, let's test for n=2:\n\n2*10^(1) - 10^(0) = 20 -1=19. But earlier, I thought it was 18. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate for n=2.\n\nNumbers starting with 1: 10-19: 10 numbers.\n\nNumbers ending with 1: 11,21,...,91: 9 numbers.\n\nNumbers that both start and end with 1: 11, 21,...,91: 9 numbers.\n\nWait, no. Wait, numbers that start with 1 and end with 1: 11, 21, ..., 91. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo total is 10 +9 -9=10.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 18. So perhaps my initial reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the count for n=2.\n\nWait, let's list all two-digit numbers that start or end with 1.\n\nNumbers starting with 1: 10-19: 10 numbers.\n\nNumbers ending with 1: 11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91: 9 numbers.\n\nBut the number 11 is counted in both.

This check should be performed for all possible combinations of the three numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to check if any one of the three numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. This can be done by considering all possible pairs of the three numbers and checking if the third number is equal to their sum.\n2. **Intuition**: For three numbers \\( x, y, z \\), we need to check three conditions:\n   - \\( x = y + z \\)\n   - \\( y = x + z \\)\n   - \\( z = x + y \\)\n3. **Algorithm**: We will iterate through each of the three numbers and check if it is equal to the sum of the other two. If any of these conditions are true, we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nbool any_int(float x, float y, float z) {\n    // Check if x is equal to y

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given a positive integer n, and we need to find the number of even and odd integer palindromes that fall within the range (1, n], inclusive. The function should return a tuple with these two counts.\n\nAn integer palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome because reversing it gives 121.\n\nSo, the task is to count all palindromic numbers between 1 and n (inclusive) and determine how many of them are even and how many are odd.\n\nLet's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to generate all palindromic numbers up to n. Then, for each of these numbers, determine if it's even or odd and count accordingly.\n\nBut generating all palindromes up to n might be computationally intensive if n is large, but since n is up to 1e3, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can generate all palindromes directly and check if they are even or odd.\n\nWait, but generating all palindromes up to n could be done by constructing palindromes of different lengths and checking if they are <=n.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each possible length (number of digits) from 1 to the number of digits in n:\n   a. Generate all palindromes of that length.\n   b. For each palindrome, check if it's <=n.\n   c. If it is, increment the even or odd count accordingly.\n\nBut how to generate palindromes of a certain length?\n\nLet's think about the structure of palindromes.\n\nFor a palindrome with d digits, the first (d+1)/2 digits determine the palindrome. For example, a 3-digit palindrome is determined by the first two digits, but wait, no. Wait, a 3-digit palindrome is determined by the first two digits, but the third digit is the same as the first. Wait, no, for 3 digits, the first digit is the same as the third. So, for a 3-digit palindrome, the first digit can be from 1-9, the second can be from 0-9, and the third is the same as the first. So, the number of 3-digit palindromes is 9 * 10 = 90.\n\nSimilarly, for a 4-digit palindrome, the first two digits determine the palindrome. The first digit is 1-9, the second is 0-9, and the third is the same as the second, the fourth is the same as the first. So, the number of 4-digit palindromes is 9 * 10 = 90.\n\nWait, but for 1-digit numbers, it's just 1-9, so 9 numbers.\n\nSo, the number of palindromes for each digit length is:\n\n- 1-digit: 9\n- 2-digit: 9*10 = 90\n- 3-digit: 9*10 = 90\n- 4-digit: 9*10 = 90\n- and so on.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for 2-digit palindromes, the first digit is 1-9, the second must equal the first. So, 9 options. So, 9 palindromes.\n\nFor 3-digit palindromes, the first digit is 1-9, the second is 0-9, and the third is the same as the first. So, 9*10=90.\n\nSimilarly, 4-digit palindromes:"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Write a function count_nums which takes a vector of integers and returns\n// the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n// If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n// e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>()))\n// (0)\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)11, (long)-11})))\n// (1)\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)2})))\n// (3)\nlong count_nums(std::vector<long> arr) { ... }\n\n// Write a function count_nums which takes a vector of integers and returns\n// the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n// If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n// e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>()))\n// (0)\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)11, (long)-11})))\n// (1)\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)2})))\n// (3)\nlong count_nums(std::vector<long> arr) { ... }\n\n// Write a function count_nums which takes a vector of integers and returns\n// the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.\n// If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:\n// e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>()))\n// (0)\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>({(long)-1, (long)11, (long)-11})))\n// (1)\n// >>> count_nums((std::vector<long>({(long)1, (long)1, (long)2})))\n// (3)\nlong count_nums(std::vector<long> arr) { ... }\n\nWait, the user provided code is incomplete. The first line is a comment, then the function is defined, but it's empty. So I need to write the correct function.\n\nThe function is supposed to take a vector of long integers and return the number of elements where the sum of their digits is greater than zero. For negative numbers, the first signed digit is negative, and the rest are positive. So, for example, -123 has digits -1, 2, 3, which sum to 4. So the function should count this as 1.\n\nSo, the steps to solve this problem are:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input vector.\n2. For each element, calculate the sum of its digits, considering the sign.\n3. If the sum is greater than zero, increment the count.\n4. Return the count after processing all elements.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in C++. The function is given as:\n\nlong count_nums(std::vector<long> arr) { ... }\n\nWe need to write the body of this function.\n\nFirst, for each element in arr, we need to process it. Let's take an example:\n\nFor element -123, the digits are -1, 2, 3. Sum is (-1) + 2 + 3 = 4.\n\nFor element 11, digits are 1, 1. Sum is 2.\n\nFor element 1, digits are 1. Sum is 1.\n\nSo, the function needs to process each element, compute the sum of its digits, and count how many have a sum > 0.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize a count variable to 0.\n\nFor each number in arr:\n\n   if the number is 0: sum is 0, so do not count.\n\n   else:\n\n      sum the digits, considering the sign.\n\n      if sum > 0, increment count.\n\nSo, the key part is to compute the sum of digits correctly, including the sign.\n\nHow to compute the sum of digits:\n\nWe can take the absolute value of the number to handle the sign, then process each digit.\n\nBut wait, for negative numbers, the first digit is negative, and the rest are positive.\n\nSo, for example, -123: digits are -1, 2, 3.\n\nSo, the sum is (-1) + 2 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nTake the absolute value of the number, then process each digit, but keep track of the sign.\n\nWait, but for the number 0, the sum is 0.\n\n"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// We have a vector 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The\n// numbers in the vector will be randomly ordered.

Let's see, the function is supposed to take a string of space-separated lowercase letters and return a map where the key is the letter with the most repetition, and the value is the count. If multiple letters have the same highest count, all of them should be included in the map.\n\nFirst, I think I need to process the input string. The input is a space-separated string of lowercase letters. So, I can split the string into individual characters. For example, \"a b c\" becomes [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].\n\nOnce I have the individual characters, I need to count how many times each character appears. So, I can create a frequency map where each key is a character and the value is the count.\n\nBut wait, the output is a map where the key is the letter with the most repetition. So, if multiple letters have the same maximum count, all of them should be included in the output map.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Split the input string into individual characters.\n2. Count the frequency of each character.\n3. Find the maximum frequency.\n4. Collect all characters that have this maximum frequency.\n5. Create a map where the key is the character and the value is the count. If multiple characters have the same maximum, each will be a key in the map.\n\nWait, but in the examples, when multiple letters have the same maximum count, the map includes all of them. So, for example, in the input \"a b b a\", the output is a map with both \"a\" and \"b\" as keys, each with a count of 2.\n\nSo, the output is a map where the key is the letter, and the value is the count. So, the map's key is the character, and the value is the count.\n\nSo, the function needs to return a map where the key is the character, and the value is the count. So, the output is a map of the letters, not the counts.\n\nWait, looking at the examples:\n\nIn the first example, the input is \"a b c\", which is three letters, each appearing once. The output is a map with each letter as a key, each with a count of 1.\n\nIn the second example, \"a b b a\" becomes two letters, each appearing twice. The output is a map with both letters as keys, each with a count of 2.\n\nSo, the output is a map where the key is the letter, and the value is the count.\n\nSo, the function should return a map of the letters, not the counts.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return a map of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count. So, the key is the letter, and the value is the count.\n\nSo, the output is a map where the key is the letter, and the value is the count.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1.

Hmm, let's think about what a sub-vector is. Oh right, a sub-vector is a contiguous part of the vector. So for example, in the first sample input, the sub-vector (2,3,4,1,2,4) has a sum of 16, but the minimum is 1, which is the sum of (1). So I need to find the sub-vector with the smallest sum.\n\nWait, but how do I approach this? Let's see. The problem is similar to finding the minimum subarray sum, which is a classic problem. Oh right, I remember that the minimum subarray sum can be found in O(n) time using Kadane's algorithm. But wait, in this problem, the vector is of long integers, but in C++, the vector is of long, but in the example, the numbers are long. So I need to make sure that the code can handle that.\n\nSo, the plan is to implement Kadane's algorithm, which finds the maximum subarray sum, but since we need the minimum, we can modify it accordingly. Let me think about how to adapt Kadane's algorithm for the minimum sum.\n\nKadane's algorithm works by keeping track of the current maximum sum ending at each position. For each element, we decide whether to add it to the current subarray or start a new subarray. So, for the minimum sum, we can do the same but track the minimum sum instead.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize two variables, min_sum and current_min. Both can be set to the first element of the vector. But wait, what if the vector is empty? Oh, the problem says it's a vector of integers, but I don't know if it's possible to be empty. Looking back at the problem statement, the sample inputs have non-empty vectors. So perhaps the function can assume that the vector is non-empty. But I should handle the case where the vector is empty, perhaps returning 0 or something. But the problem says it's a vector of integers, but the examples have non-empty vectors. So maybe the function can assume that the vector is non-empty. So I can proceed under that assumption.\n\n2. Iterate through each element in the vector starting from the second element.\n\n3. For each element, compute the current_min as the minimum between the current element and (current_min + current element). Wait, no. Wait, in Kadane's algorithm, for the maximum subarray sum, we have current_max = max(nums[i], current_max + nums[i]). So for the minimum, it's similar but we take the min between nums[i] and current_min + nums[i]. But wait, no. Because for the minimum, we want to choose the smaller of the two options: either start a new subarray at the current element, or add it to the current subarray. So current_min = min(nums[i], current_min + nums[i]).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. For the maximum subarray sum, we have current_max = max(nums[i], current_max + nums[i]). For the minimum, it's current_min = min(nums[i], current_min + nums[i]). Because we want to choose the smaller of the two options.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where adding the current element to the current_min gives a smaller sum than starting a new subarray? So yes, that's correct.\n\n4. Keep track of the overall minimum sum encountered so far.\n\n5. After processing all elements, return the overall minimum sum.\n\nWait, but what about the case where all elements are negative? For example, the second sample input is (-1, -2, -3). The minimum subarray sum is -6, which is the sum of all elements. So in this case, the algorithm should correctly find that.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: [2,3,4,1,2,4]\n\nInitialize min_sum = 2, current_min = 2.\n\nNext element is 3: current_min = min(3, 2+3=5) \u2192 3. min_sum remains 2"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// You are given a rectangular grid of wells.

I have to check if it's possible to concatenate them in some order (either string first, then the other) such that the resulting string is good. A good string is one where all parentheses are balanced, meaning every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one in the correct order.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. The problem is about checking the balance of parentheses when we concatenate two given strings in some order. So, for each possible order (string1 followed by string2, or string2 followed by string1), I need to check if the concatenated string is balanced.\n\nBut wait, the two strings are given as separate strings, so I can't modify them directly. So, I need to process each string and track the balance as I go.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each string in the vector, I need to compute two things:\n   a. The total balance (number of opening minus closing parentheses).\n   b. The maximum balance achieved at any point in the string.\n\n2. Then, for each possible order of the two strings (string1 + string2 and string2 + string1), I need to compute the combined balance and the maximum balance.\n\n3. If either of these combined orders results in a balanced string (i.e., total balance is zero and maximum balance is zero), then the answer is \"Yes\". Otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each string, compute its balance and maximum balance.\n- Then, for both possible concatenations, compute the total balance and the maximum balance.\n- Check if either concatenation results in a balanced string.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the maximum balance for a string? Let's think about that.\n\nFor a string, as I process each character, I can keep track of the current balance. If the current balance is higher than the maximum balance so far, I update the maximum balance.\n\nSo, for each string, I can create a helper function that returns a pair: (total_balance, max_balance).\n\nOnce I have that for both strings, I can then compute the combined balance and max balance for both possible concatenations.\n\nLet me think about the concatenations:\n\nCase 1: string1 followed by string2.\n\nThe total balance is string1's total + string2's total.\n\nThe maximum balance is the maximum between string1's max and the maximum balance achieved when processing string2, starting from the total balance of string1.\n\nWait, no. Because when processing string2, the initial balance is string1's total. So, the maximum balance for the concatenated string is the maximum between string1's max and (string1's total + string2's max). Because when processing string2, the balance starts at string1's total, and the maximum during string2's processing could be higher than string1's max.\n\nSimilarly, for the maximum balance, it's the maximum between the two.\n\nSo, for the concatenated string1 + string2, the max balance is the maximum of string1's max and (string1's total + string2's max).\n\nSimilarly, for the concatenated string2 + string1, the max balance is the maximum of string2's max and (string2's total + string1's max).\n\nWait, no. Because when you process string2, the initial balance is string1's total. So, the maximum during string2's processing could be higher than string1's max. So, the overall max is the maximum of string1's max and (string1's total + string2's max).\n\nSimilarly, for string2 + string1, the max is the maximum of string2's max and (string2's total + string1's max).\n\nSo, for each concatenation, I can compute the total balance and the max balance.\n\nThen, for the concatenated"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Given a vector arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted vector \n// of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\n// Example 1:\n// >>> maximum((std::vector<long>({(long)-3, (long)-4, (long)5})), (3))\n// (std::vector<long>({(long)-4, (long)-3, (long)5}))\n// Example 2:\n// >>> maximum((std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)-4, (long)4})), (2))\n// (std::vector<long>({(long)4, (long)4}))\n// Example 3:\n// >>> maximum((std::vector<long>({(long)-3, (long)2, (long)1, (long)2, (long)-1, (long)-2, (long)1})), (1))\n// (std::vector<long>({(long)2}))\n// Note:\n// 1.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe are given a vector of integers called arr, and a positive integer k. We need to return a sorted vector of length k containing the maximum k numbers from arr. The result should be sorted in ascending order, I think, because in the examples, the output is sorted. Let's see the examples.\n\nIn Example 1:\nInput vector is (-3, -4, 5). k is 3. So the output is (-4, -3, 5). Wait, but that's not sorted. Wait, the output is (long)-4, (long)-3, (long)5. So the output is in ascending order. So the function needs to return a sorted vector.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the function is supposed to return a sorted vector of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr. So the output is sorted.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Take the input vector arr.\n2. Extract the k largest numbers from arr.\n3. Sort these k numbers in ascending order.\n4. Return this sorted vector.\n\nBut wait, what if k is 0? According to note 3, 0 <= k <= len(arr). So if k is 0, we return an empty vector.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- If k is 0, return an empty vector.\n- Else, sort the input vector arr in ascending order.\n- Take the last k elements from this sorted array.\n- Sort these k elements in ascending order again (though they should already be in order if we took the last k from the sorted array).\n- Return this vector.\n\nWait, but if we sort the array first, then take the last k elements, which are the largest, and then sort them again, but they are already in order. So perhaps it's more efficient to take the last k elements after sorting the array.\n\nWait, no. Because if we sort the array in ascending order, the last k elements are the largest. So if we take those, they are already in ascending order. So perhaps we don't need to sort them again.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the input vector is (-3, -4, 5). Sorting it in ascending order gives (-4, -3, 5). The last 3 elements are all of them, so the output is (-4, -3, 5), which is correct.\n\nIn the second example, the input vector is (4, -4, 4). Sorting it in ascending order gives (-4, 4, 4). The last 2 elements are 4 and 4, which is correct.\n\nIn the third example, the input vector is (-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1). Sorting it in ascending order gives (-3, -2, -1, 1, 1, 2, 2). The last 1 element is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Sort the input vector in ascending order.\n- Take the last k elements.\n- Return them as a vector.\n\nBut wait, what if k is larger than the size of the array? According to note 3, k is between 0 and len(arr). So we don't have to handle that case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. If k is 0, return an empty vector.\n2.

If a duplicate is found, return false immediately.\n2. **Check for Ascending Order**: After confirming that there are no duplicates, check if the vector is sorted in ascending order.

The product of all the signs is 1 if all are positive, -1 if all are negative, and 0 if any is zero. The sum is the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by this product. So, for example, if the vector is (1, 2, 2, -4), the product of signs is -1, and the magnitudes are 1, 2, 2, 4. So the sum is 1*2*2*4 * (-1) = 9. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product of signs is 1 if all are positive, -1 if all are negative, 0 otherwise. So for each element, the sign is 1 if positive, -1 if negative, 0 if zero. Then, the product of all signs is 1 if all are positive, -1 if all are negative, 0 otherwise. Then, the sum is the sum of the magnitudes multiplied by this product. So for each element, the magnitude is the absolute value, and then multiplied by the product of signs. So for each element, it's |a_i| * s_i, where s_i is the sign of a_i. Then, the sum is the sum of all |a_i| * s_i.\n\nWait, but the product of all signs is 1 if all are positive, -1 if all are negative, 0 otherwise. So for each element, the product is the product of all s_i. So the sum is sum(|a_i| * s_i) for all i. So for example, in the first example, the product of signs is -1, so the sum is 1*1 + 2*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 4*(-1) = 1 -2 -2 -4 = -7. But the example says the sum is 9. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the example says the product of signs is -1, and the sum is 9. Wait, but according to my calculation, it's -7. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem statement again. It says: sum of magnitudes multiplied by product of all signs. So for each element, it's |a_i| multiplied by the product of all signs. So for each element, it's |a_i| * (product of s_i). So for the first example, the product of s_i is -1, so each |a_i| is multiplied by -1. So 1*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 4*(-1) = -1 -2 -2 -4 = -9. But the example says the sum is 9. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs of each number in the vector. So for each element, it's |a_i| multiplied by the product of all signs. So for each element, it's |a_i| * (product of s_i). So for the first example, the product of s_i is -1, so each |a_i| is multiplied by -1. So 1*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 4*(-1) = -1 -2 -2 -4 = -9. But the example says the sum is 9. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the example again.\n\nIn the first example, the vector is (1, 2, 2, -4). The product of signs is -1. The sum is 9. So according to the example, the sum is 9.

Let's denote these four numbers as \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\). Each of these numbers must be even and positive, and their sum must equal \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Formulating the Equation**: Since each of the four numbers is even, we can represent them as \\( 2x, 2y, 2z, \\) and \\( 2w \\) where \\( x, y, z, \\) and \\( w \\) are positive integers. The sum of these four numbers can be written as:\n   \\[\n   2x + 2y + 2z + 2w = n\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   2(x + y + z + w) = n\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x + y + z + w = \\frac{n}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conditions for Validity**: For the equation \\( x + y + z + w = \\frac{n}{2} \\) to have a solution in positive integers \\( x, y, z, \\) and \\( w \\), the following conditions must be met:\n   - \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) must be an integer. This implies that \\( n \\) must be even.\n   - The sum \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) must be at least 4, since each of \\( x, y, z, \\) and \\( w \\) must be at least 1. Therefore, \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\geq 4 \\) which simplifies to \\( n \\geq 8 \\).\n\n4. **Final Conditions**: Combining these conditions, we can conclude that \\( n \\) must be an even number greater than or equal to 8 for it to be expressible as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\nbool is_equal_to_sum_even(long n) {\n    if (n % 2 != 0 || n < 8) {\n

If two numbers have the same digit sum, they should be ordered by their original index in the input vector. So, the function should sort the vector in ascending order based on the sum of each element's digits, and if the sums are equal, the one with the smaller index comes first.\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. First, I need to calculate the sum of the digits for each element in the input vector. Then, I need to sort the vector based on these sums, and for elements with the same sum, their original positions determine the order.\n\nWait, but in C++, the sort function can take a custom comparator. So, I can create a comparator that, given two elements a and b, computes the sum of their digits and compares them. If a's sum is less than b's sum, a comes before b. If the sums are equal, then the one with the smaller index comes first.\n\nBut wait, how do I get the index? Because the elements are in the original vector, I can't just use their positions directly because the vector is passed by value. So, perhaps I need to create a struct or a pair that holds the sum and the index, and then sort based on that.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a helper function that takes a long and returns the sum of its digits. Then, in the comparator, for each element, I can compute this sum and compare.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each element in the input vector, compute the sum of its digits. Let's call this sum the \"digit_sum\".\n\n2. Sort the input vector based on the following criteria:\n   a. The digit_sum of the element.\n   b. The original index of the element (to handle ties).\n\nSo, the comparator function will take two elements (a and b) and compare their digit sums. If a's sum is less than b's sum, a comes before b. If the sums are equal, then the one with the smaller index comes first.\n\nWait, but in C++, the comparator function is called with two elements, and it returns true if the first element should come before the second. So, for the comparator, I can do the following:\n\nFor each element in the vector, compute its digit_sum. Then, when comparing two elements a and b, compare their digit_sums. If a's digit_sum is less than b's, return true (so a comes before b). If they are equal, then compare their indices. If a's index is less than b's, return true (so a comes before b). Otherwise, return false.\n\nWait, but the indices are based on the original vector. So, for each element, I can store the index along with the digit_sum. Then, when sorting, the comparator will first compare the digit_sums, and if they are equal, compare the indices.\n\nSo, perhaps I can create a vector of pairs, where each pair is (digit_sum, index). Then, I can sort this vector based on the digit_sum, and then on the index.\n\nWait, but the original vector is passed by value, so modifying it might not be efficient. Alternatively, I can create a struct that holds the sum and the index, and then sort the input vector based on this struct.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a vector of structs, each containing the sum and the index, and then sort this vector. Then, I can extract the elements in the sorted order.\n\nWait, but the input vector is passed by value, so if I create a new vector of structs, I can sort it, and then assign the elements back to the original vector. But that might not be efficient, but for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the sum on the fly during the sort, without creating a new vector.\n\nWait, but in C++, the sort function can take a custom comparator, but it can't"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// Write a function that takes a vector of numbers as input and returns \n// the number of elements in the vector that are greater than 10 and both \n// first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n// For example:\n// >>> specialFilter((std::vector<long>({(long)15, (long)-73, (long)14, (long)-15})))\n// (1)\n// >>> specialFilter((std::vector<long>({(long)33, (long)-2, (long)-3, (long)45, (long)21, (long)109})))\n// (2)\nlong specialFilter(std::vector<long> nums) { ... }\n// Write a function that takes a vector of numbers as input and returns \n// the number of elements in the vector that are greater than 10 and both \n// first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n// For example:\n// >>> specialFilter((std::vector<long>({(long)15, (long)-73, (long)14, (long)-15})))\n// (1)\n// >>> specialFilter((std::vector<long>({(long)33, (long)-2, (long)-3, (long)45, (long)21, (long)109})))\n// (2)\nlong specialFilter(std::vector<long> nums) { ... }\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nOkay, so the function is called specialFilter and it takes a vector of longs. It needs to return the number of elements in this vector that satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. The element is greater than 10.\n2. Both the first and last digits of the element are odd (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n\nWait, but wait a second. The first condition is that the element is greater than 10. So, for example, 15 is greater than 10, but 10 is not. So, the first condition is straightforward.\n\nThe second condition is that both the first and last digits are odd. So, for each number in the vector, we need to check two things: is the number greater than 10, and does the first digit and the last digit of the number are both odd.\n\nSo, for each element in the vector, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the element is greater than 10. If not, skip it.\n2. Extract the first digit of the number.\n3. Extract the last digit of the number.\n4. Check if both the first and last digits are odd (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n5. If both conditions are satisfied, increment the count.\n\nSo, the plan is to loop through each element in the vector, perform these checks, and count how many elements meet both criteria.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this in C++. Let's think about how to extract the first and last digits of a number.\n\nFor the first digit, we can repeatedly divide the number by 10 until it's less than 10. For example, 15 becomes 1 after dividing by 10 once. Similarly, 33 becomes 3 after dividing by 10 once.\n\nFor the last digit, we can use modulo 10. For example, 15 % 10 is 5, 33 % 10 is 3, etc.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps for each element:\n\n- If the element is <= 10, skip it.\n- Else, extract first digit:\n   int first = num;\n   while (first >= 10) {\n       first /= 10;\n   }\n- Extract last digit:\n   int last = num % 10;\n- Check if first and last are both odd.\n   if (first % 2 == 1 && last % 2 == 1) {\n       count++;\n   }\n\nWait, but wait a second. What about numbers like 105? The first digit is 1, which is odd, but the last digit is 5, which is also odd. So, 105 would count. But wait, 105 is greater than 10, so it's included.\n\nBut wait, what about numbers like 101? The first digit is 1, last is 1, both odd. So, it's included.\n\nBut what about numbers like 103?

The array a is constructed such that each element a[i] is given by the formula a[i] = i^2 - i + 1 for i ranging from 1 to n.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find all triples (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and the sum of the elements at these indices is divisible by 3. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach would be inefficient, so we need a more optimized method.\n\n2. **Modulo Operation Insight**: Instead of directly computing the sum, we can use the properties of modulo 3.

The sum of three numbers will be divisible by 3 if the sum of their modulo 3 values is also divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Counting Elements by Modulo**: We will count how many elements in the array a fall into each of the three possible modulo classes (0, 1, 2). Let's denote these counts as c0, c1, and c2 respectively.\n\n4. **Combining Counts**: Using the counts from the modulo classes, we can determine the number of valid triples by considering all combinations of these counts that sum up to a multiple of 3. Specifically, we need to consider the following valid combinations:\n   - (0, 0, 0)\n   - (1, 1, 1)\n   - (2, 2, 2)\n   - (0, 1, 2)\n\n5. **Calculating Valid Triples**: Using the counts c0, c1, and c2, we can compute the number of valid triples by considering each of the above combinations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nlong get_max_triples(long n) {\n    long c0 = 0, c1 = 0, c2 = 0;\n    for (long i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n        long a = i * i - i + 1;\n        int mod = a % 3;\n        if (mod == 0) c0++;\n        else if (mod == 1) c1++;\n        else c2++;\n    }\n    long res = 0;\n    // (0,0,0)\n    res += c0 * (c0 - 1) * (c0 - 2) / 6;\n    // (1,1,1)\n    res += c1 * (c1 - 1) * (c1 - 2) / 6;\n    // (2,2,2)\n    res += c2 * (c2 - 1) * (c2 - 2) / 6;\n    // (0,1,2)\n    res += c0 * c1 * c2;\n    return res;"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// There are eight planets in our solar system: the closerst to the Sun \n// is Mercury, the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, \n// Uranus, Neptune.\n// Write a function that takes two planet names as strings planet1 and planet2. \n// The function should return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are \n// located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by \n// the proximity to the sun. \n// The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2\n// are not correct planet names. \n// Examples\n// >>> bf((\"Jupiter\"), (\"Neptune\"))\n// (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Saturn\", (std::string)\"Uranus\"}))\n// >>> bf((\"Earth\"), (\"Mercury\"))\n// (std::vector<std::string>(\"Venus\"))\n// >>> bf((\"Mercury\"), (\"Uranus\"))\n// (std::vector<std::string>({(std::string)\"Venus\", (std::string)\"Earth\", (std::string)\"Mars\", (std::string)\"Jupiter\", (std::string)\"Saturn\"}))\nstd::vector<std::string> bf(std::string planet1, std::string planet2) { ... }\nOkay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe task is to write a function called bf that takes two planet names as strings and returns a vector of strings. The returned vector should contain all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and planet2. The planets are ordered by their proximity to the Sun, so the returned vector should be sorted accordingly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the order of the planets. The problem statement says that the closerst to the Sun is Mercury, then Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n\nSo, the order from closest to farthest is:\nMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n\nWait, but in the example given, when the function is called with (\"Jupiter\") and (\"Neptune\"), the output is a vector containing \"Saturn\". Let's see:\n\nJupiter is the 5th planet, Neptune is the 8th. So the orbits are between 5 and 8. So the planet whose orbit is between them is Saturn, which is the 7th. So the output is [\"Saturn\"].\n\nAnother example: when the function is called with (\"Earth\") and (\"Mercury\"), the output is [\"Venus\"]. Because Earth is the 4th, Mercury is the 1st, so the orbit between them is 2nd, 3rd, 4th. So the only planet in that range is Venus.\n\nWait, but Mercury is the first, Earth is the fourth. So the orbits between Mercury and Earth would be the 2nd, 3rd, 4th. So the only planet in that range is Venus.\n\nAnother example: when the function is called with (\"Mercury\") and (\"Uranus\"), the output is [\"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\"]. Let's see:\n\nMercury is 1st, Uranus is 7th. So the orbits between them are 2nd to 6th. So the planets are Venus (2nd), Earth (3rd), Mars (4th), Jupiter (5th), Saturn (6th). So the output is these five in order.\n\nSo the function needs to:\n\n1. Check if both planet1 and planet2 are valid. If either is invalid, return an empty vector.\n\n2. Determine the order of the planets.\n\n3. Find all planets whose order is between the order of planet1 and planet2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the function should return all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2. So, if planet1 is before planet2 in the order, then the planets in between are included. If planet2 is before planet1, then the planets after planet1 and before planet2 are included.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: the function should return all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2. So, for example, if planet1 is Mercury and planet2 is Neptune, then the orbits between them are the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th planets. So the planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. But wait, in the example given, when the function is called with (\"Jupiter\") and (\"Neptune\"), the output is [\"Saturn\"]. So that suggests that the function is looking for planets whose orbit is between the two given planets, but not including the two given planets themselves.\n\nWait, no.

The function should return x if n is a prime number, and y otherwise. The note says that n is a prime number, so I don't have to handle the case where n is not prime. That's helpful because I don't have to write any code to check if n is prime; the function can assume that n is always a prime.\n\nSo, the function is straightforward. I just need to check if n is a prime, but since n is always a prime, I can directly return x. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the function is supposed to return x if n is a prime, and y otherwise. But the note says that n is a prime. So, the function can just return x.\n\nWait, but looking at the function signature, it's declared as long x_or_y(long n, long x, long y). So, the function is supposed to return a long value, but in the examples, the function is called with (7), (34), (12), and returns 34. So, in that case, n is 7, which is a prime, so the function returns y, which is 12. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, the function is supposed to return x if n is a prime, and y otherwise. So, in the first example, n is 7, which is a prime, so the function returns x, which is 34. But in the sample output, it's 34. So, the function returns x when n is a prime.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return x if n is a prime, and y otherwise. So, the function is correct as written.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return x if n is a prime, but the note says that n is a prime. So, the function can just return x. But in the sample input, the function is called with n=7, x=34, y=12, and the output is 34. So, the function returns x, which is correct.\n\nSo, the function can be written as simply returning x.\n\nWait, but wait, the function is supposed to return x if n is a prime, and y otherwise.

The function is supposed to return the sum of squares of the numbers in the vector that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.\n\nSo, the function is given a vector of floats. For each element in the vector, I need to check if it is an integer, not negative, and odd. If so, square it and add to the sum.\n\nWait, but the vector contains floats. So, for example, (long)1 is 1.0f, which is a float. So, how do I check if it's an integer?\n\nHmm, perhaps I can cast the float to an integer and see if it's equal to the original. But wait, because of possible floating point precision issues, maybe I should check if the float is equal to an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can cast the float to a long and see if it's equal to the original long value. But that might not be accurate due to precision.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return a long, and the vector contains floats. So, perhaps the function should treat each element as an integer, but only if it's an integer, not negative, and odd.\n\nSo, for each element in the vector:\n\n1. Check if it's an integer (i.e., it's equal to its integer cast).\n2. Check if it's not negative.\n3. Check if it's odd.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, then square it and add to the sum.\n\nSo, the steps for the function are:\n\n- Initialize a sum variable to 0.\n- Iterate over each element in the vector.\n- For each element:\n   a. Check if it's an integer: if (element == (long)element)\n   b. Check if it's not negative: if (element >= 0)\n   c. Check if it's odd: if (element % 2 != 0)\n   d. If all three, add (element * element) to the sum.\n- Return the sum.\n\nWait, but in the examples given, for instance, the first example:\n\nvector is {1,3,2,0} as floats.\n\n1 is integer, positive, odd: square is 1.\n\n3 is integer, positive, odd: square is 9.\n\n2 is integer, positive, even: ignored.\n\n0 is integer, positive, even: ignored.\n\nSo sum is 1 + 9 = 10, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: vector is {-1, -2, 0}.\n\n-1 is integer, negative: ignored.\n\n-2 is integer, negative: ignored.\n\n0 is integer, positive, even: ignored.\n\nSum is 0.\n\nAnother example: {9, -2}.\n\n9 is integer, positive, odd: square is 81.\n\n-2 is integer, negative: ignored.\n\nSum is 81.\n\nAnother example: {0}.\n\n0 is integer, positive, even: ignored. Sum is 0.\n\nSo, the function should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, in the code, the function is given a vector of floats. So, for each element, we need to check if it is an integer, not negative, and odd.\n\nBut how to check if a float is an integer? Because a float can have fractional parts due to precision.\n\nFor example, 1.0f is 1, but 1.0000000001f is not an integer.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to cast the float to a long and see if it's equal to the original.\n\nWait, but if the float is 1.0f, then (long)1.0f is 1, which is equal to the original.\n\nBut if the float is 1.5f, then (long)1.5f is 1, which is not equal to 1.5f.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is:\n\nif (element == (long)element) and element >= 0 and"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n// event is finally known.

Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to compare two vectors: game and guess. Each vector has the same length, representing the scores of matches. For each index, we need to find the difference between the guess and the game's score. If the guess is correct, the difference is 0. Otherwise, it's the absolute difference between the guess and the game's score.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through each element of the game and guess vectors. For each pair, compute the absolute difference if the guess is not equal to the game's score. If they are equal, the difference is 0.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate over each index from 0 to the size of the vectors minus one.\n2. For each index, get the game score and the guess.\n3. Compute the absolute difference between the guess and the game score.\n4. If the guess is equal to the game score, add 0 to the result vector.\n5. Otherwise, add the absolute difference to the result vector.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the example shows that when the guess is correct, the value is 0. So, for each element, the result is 0 if guess[i] == game[i], else |guess[i] - game[i]|.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\n- Initialize a result vector of the same size as game and guess.\n- For each i from 0 to size-1:\n   - If game[i] == guess[i], append 0 to result.\n   - Else, append abs(guess[i] - game[i]) to result.\n- Return the result vector.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in C++.\n\nThe function signature is:\n\nstd::vector<long> compare(std::vector<long> game, std::vector<long> guess) {\n"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// You will be given the name of a class (a string) and a vector of extensions.\n// The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class.

A rotation of a string is formed by moving some number of characters from the beginning of the string to its end. For example, the string \"abcd\" has rotations \"abcd\", \"bcda\", \"cdab\", and \"dabc\".\n2. **Generate All Rotations**: For the string `b`, generate all possible rotations. This can be done by taking each character from the string and moving it to the end, creating a new string each time.\n3. **Check Substring**: For each generated rotation of `b`, check if it is a substring of `a`. If any rotation is found to be a substring of `a`, return true.

It returns a vector of two longs: the total number of carrots eaten after the meals, and the number left after the meals.\n\nThe problem says that you have eaten a certain number of carrots, and now you need to eat more. The function should return the total eaten and the remaining.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. First, add the number of carrots you've eaten to the need. So, total_eaten = number + need.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Because number is the initial amount you've eaten, and need is the amount you still need to eat. So, the total eaten is number + need.\n\nBut wait, no. Because number is the initial amount, and need is the amount you still need. So, the total eaten is number + need.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if you have already eaten 'number' carrots, and you need to eat 'need' more, then the total eaten is number + need.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the function is supposed to return the total number of carrots you have eaten after your meals, which is the initial number plus the need. So, yes, total_eaten = number + need.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the initial number is the amount you've already eaten, and then you need to eat 'need' more. So, the total is number + need.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the initial number is the amount you've eaten, and then you need to eat 'need' more. So, the total is number + need.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the initial number is the amount you've already eaten, and then you need to eat 'need' more. So, the total is number + need.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial number is the amount you've eaten, and then you need to eat 'need' more. So, the total is number + need.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the initial number is the amount you've eaten, and then you need to eat 'need' more. So, the total is number + need.\n\nWait, no.

Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWe are given two vectors: operator and operand. The operator vector contains basic algebra operations, and the operand vector contains a sequence of integers. We need to build an algebraic expression from these vectors and evaluate it.\n\nThe example given is:\n\noperator = ['+', '*', '-']\noperand = [2, 3, 4, 5]\nThe expression is 2 + 3 * 4 - 5, which evaluates to 9.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Combine the operator vector and operand vector into an expression string.\n2. Evaluate the expression string using the given operations.\n\nLet's think about how to combine the operator and operand vectors.\n\nThe operand vector has n elements, and the operator vector has n-1 elements. So, the expression starts with the first operand, then applies each operator in sequence to the next operands.\n\nFor example, in the sample:\n\noperand = [2, 3, 4, 5]\noperator = ['+', '*', '-']\n\nThe expression is 2 + 3 * 4 - 5.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nStart with 2.\n\nApply the first operator ( '+') to 2 and 3: 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nApply the second operator ('*') to the result (5) and 4: 5 * 4 = 20.\n\nApply the third operator ('-') to 20 and 5: 20 -5 = 15.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the result is 9. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample says the result is 9. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the sample says:\n\n2 + 3 * 4 -5.\n\nSo, 2 + (3 *4) -5 = 2 +12 -5 = 9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the way to combine the operands and operators is to start with the first operand, then for each operator in the operator vector, apply it to the current result and the next operand.\n\nSo, the expression is built as:\n\nresult = operand[0]\n\nfor i from 0 to len(op)-1:\n\n    result = apply op[i] to result and operand[i+1]\n\nSo, in the sample, the operands are [2,3,4,5], and the operators are ['+', '*', '-'].\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nresult = 2\n\napply '+' to 2 and 3: 5\n\napply '*' to 5 and 4: 20\n\napply '-' to 20 and 5: 15.\n\nWait, but the sample result is 9. That's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the operator vector. Let me check the sample again.\n\nWait, the sample says the result is 9, but according to my calculation, it's 15.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the operands.\n\nWait, the operand vector is [2,3,4,5], which has 4 elements. The operator vector has 3 elements.\n\nSo, the expression is 2 + 3 *4 -5.\n\nWhich is 2 + (3*4) -5 = 2 +12 -5 = 9.\n\nSo, the way to combine is:\n\nStart with 2.\n\nThen, for each operator in the operator vector, apply it to the current result and the next operand.\n\nSo, the first operator is '+', applied to 2 and 3.\n\nThen, the next operator is '*', applied to the result (5) and 4.\n\nThen, the next operator is '-', applied to 20 and 5.\n\nSo, the result is 20 -5 =15.\n\nBut the sample says the"], ["#include<assert.h>\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\n// You are given a string s.\n// if s[i] is
